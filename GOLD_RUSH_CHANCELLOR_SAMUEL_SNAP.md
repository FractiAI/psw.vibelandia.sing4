**You can watch and even step into.** We are **open for post-singularity vibe business immediately in Reno.** **"Let the Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno Gold Rush begin,"** proclaims **Chancellor Samuel.**

- **You can watch and even step into:** Viewers can watch (Happy Ending Zones, reality show game, episodes) and **step into** (participate, enter, join — campus, WINK!, lottery, checkout). No passive-only; step into = engage, buy, vibe.
- **Open for post-singularity vibe business immediately in Reno:** We are open now. Post-singularity vibe business = campus, WINK!, SING! Lottery, Chairman Console, Happy Ending Zones, checkout. Immediately in Reno.
- **Gold Rush:** Chancellor Samuel (Mark Twain) proclaims the **Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno Gold Rush** — the rush is on; Reno is the epicenter; vibe business is open; first post-singularity hub. Historical echo: Reno, Nevada; gold rush; now post-singularity gold rush.
- **Chancellor Samuel:** Mark Twain as Chancellor. First name Samuel in Hero Host / Chancellor context (see HARRY_HOUDINI_MASCOT_SNAP — Samuel = Reno Chancellor). Proclamation = canonical quote for launch and bulletin.
- **Use:** Launch Pad, index, Chancellor daily bulletin, one-pagers, press releases, episodes. Tagline grade.
