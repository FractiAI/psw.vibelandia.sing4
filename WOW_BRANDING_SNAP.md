## BRAND

**WOW!**

- **Syntax:** ALL CAPS + ! (per [VIBE_BRAND_SYNTAX_ALL_CAPS_EXCLAMATION.md](./VIBE_BRAND_SYNTAX_ALL_CAPS_EXCLAMATION.md)).
- **Usage:** Pre-singularity cost vs Us comparison. **We use WOW! to launch everything** — including **Proposals SNAP** (free consultation & tailored proposal for enterprise/community). Always at bottom of Launch Pad. The WOW! moment.
- **Meaning:** Pre-singularity costs (time, human talent, equipment, office space, time, env impact) versus Us (VIBELANDIA!) — the contrast that delivers the WOW! Drives launch, showroom, and proposals alike.
- **In-place experience:** WOW! format is designed to be experienced on the page — breadth and genuineness in the content itself. Do not replace WOW! sections with links; deliver the moment in-place.
- **User surface, not developer surface:** README and all skins target our high-value vibers, fans, cast, and crew. No dev-only copy front and center; deploy/env/repo live in README_TRADITIONAL or builder docs.

## RULE

- **WOW!** = branded section at bottom of Launch Pad. Pre-singularity cost (time, human talent, equipment, office space, time, environmental impact) **versus Us**. **We use WOW! to launch everything** — including **Proposals SNAP** (Gianni's Dressing Room: free consultation & tailored proposal).
- **In-place experience:** Do not make WOW! format into links. Deliver breadth and genuineness on the page; readers experience the moment here.
- **Always** include this snap at bottom of Launch Pad. See [interfaces/launch-pad.html](./interfaces/launch-pad.html). See [README.md](./README.md) for WOW! — Launch everything.
- **Pre-singularity cost** = time, human talent, equipment, office space, time, environmental impact (the old way).
- **Us** = VIBELANDIA! / post-singularity — the new way. The contrast is the WOW!
- Pre-singularity copyrights respected. Narrative only; no third-party affiliation.
