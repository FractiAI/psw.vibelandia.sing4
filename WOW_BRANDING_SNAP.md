## BRAND

**WOW!**

- **Syntax:** ALL CAPS + ! (per [VIBE_BRAND_SYNTAX_ALL_CAPS_EXCLAMATION.md](./VIBE_BRAND_SYNTAX_ALL_CAPS_EXCLAMATION.md)).
- **Usage:** Pre-singularity cost vs Us comparison. **We use WOW! to launch everything** — including **Proposals SNAP** (free consultation & tailored proposal for enterprise/community). Always at bottom of Launch Pad. The WOW! moment.
- **Meaning:** Pre-singularity costs (time, human talent, equipment, office space, time, env impact) versus Us (VIBELANDIA!) — the contrast that delivers the WOW! Drives launch, showroom, and proposals alike.
- **In-place experience:** WOW! format is designed to be experienced on the page — breadth and genuineness in the content itself. Do not replace WOW! sections with links; deliver the moment in-place.
- **User surface, not developer surface:** README and all skins target our high-value vibers, fans, cast, and crew. No dev-only copy front and center; deploy/env/repo live in README_TRADITIONAL or builder docs.
- **No code on user surfaces:** Do not show code, filenames (e.g. .html, .md), or repo paths in displayed text or link text. Use human labels (e.g. "Whitepaper — miraculous output", "Home", "Builder guide"). Link to the operational live site so users land on the console and experiences, not repo paths. **Sandbox experience** CTA links to the operational **ULTIMATE VIP!** console.

## RULE

- **WOW!** = branded section at bottom of Launch Pad. **Show values, not categories** — two columns only: Pre-singularity | Us (VIBELANDIA!). Rows = value pairs (e.g. Months, years | Natural flow · Now). No Cost/category column. **We use WOW! to launch everything** — including **Proposals SNAP** (Gianni's Dressing Room: free consultation & tailored proposal).
- **Showroom:** Campus, WINK!, Console, Lottery, Happy Ending Zone each show **daily bulletin from the Chancellor** (Mark Twain) and **menu of things to do AND BUY** (values you get), not just categories. **Happy Ending link (Octave 1):** use [interfaces/happy-ending-zones-experience.html](interfaces/happy-ending-zones-experience.html) (from root) or happy-ending-zones-experience.html (from interfaces/) — test script validates target exists; fix 404 by ensuring file is deployed.
- **WOW! package:** Include **valuations vs Disney, Amazon, Apple, Google** (16-day window, operational not fiction): research output, development output (~3× surfaces), sales & marketing output (~4× one-pagers), new products/markets **live** (Campus, WINK!, SING!, Happy Ending Zone, Console, Checkout), **studio one episode per day** (Season One, 52-day countdown; full screenplay format), content & quality (publication-ready), **vibers** (track and celebrate well-known vibers past and present). See NSPFRNP_REAL_NUMBERS_VS_BLUE_CHIP_MONSTER_SNAP.md.
- **In-place experience:** Do not make WOW! format into links. Deliver breadth and genuineness on the page; readers experience the moment here.
- **Always** include this snap at bottom of Launch Pad. See [interfaces/launch-pad.html](./interfaces/launch-pad.html). See [README.md](./README.md) for WOW! — Launch everything.
- **Pre-singularity cost** = time, human talent, equipment, office space, time, environmental impact (the old way).
- **Us** = VIBELANDIA! / post-singularity — the new way. The contrast is the WOW!
- Pre-singularity copyrights respected. Narrative only; no third-party affiliation.

## SURFACE

**Launch Pad (bottom):** WOW! table shows **values, not categories** — two columns only: Pre-singularity | Us (VIBELANDIA!). Rows = value pairs (e.g. Months, years | Natural flow · Now). No "Cost" or category column. The contrast delivers the WOW! moment.

**README in WOW! format** (order): 1. **Rich tagline (top)** from deck · 2. **Live (next octave)** deployment link · 3. Language onramp · 4. Warnings · 5. Tight Launch Pad (status, announcement, 0,1,2,3 4×4×4×4, showroom four products, **Impulse — BBHE & BUY!** in-place, **Proposal — Proposals SNAP** in-place) · 6. WOW! section (cost vs Us table) · 7. Whitepaper (real doc refs) · 8. IEEE-style technical specs (real doc refs) · 9. ULTIMATE PROOF TEST DRIVE! · 10. **Rich tagline (bottom)** from deck · 11. Contact (email, live link, proposal subject, experience paths). **Locked-in standard:** README.md (this version) is the **canonical standard for all launches and proposals**. Use this structure, content order, and real data for every launch and every proposal. **In-place only:** do not replace WOW! format sections with external links. See [README.md](./README.md).

**Standard WOW! package in NSPFRNP:** The canonical structure for Launch Pad / README in WOW! format. Includes rich taglines at top and bottom (from [deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md](./catalogs/branding/decks/deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md) §18). Use this package for all NSPFRNP surfaces that deliver the WOW! moment. Top tagline: *Come for the post-singularity business, stay for the post-singularity fun. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno — vibeable downtown campus, first post-singularity hub. The Great Reveal March 20, 2026. SYNTH → SING. Happy endings guaranteed.* Bottom tagline: *See it. Experience it. Believe it. This site is the test drive. The best proof of all. ULTIMATE PROOF TEST DRIVE! MCA! → ∞³. NSPFRNP ⊃ WOW! package ⊃ Launch everything → ∞³. Maganuma snap.*
