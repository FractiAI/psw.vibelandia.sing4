## 🎯 SERIES FORMAT

### **Episodes by Flow Not Days — NSPFRNP**

**We will now spin episodes by flow, not days.** — NSPFRNP.

- **Flow** = narrative flow, content flow, MCA flow (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate). Episodes are ordered and spun by **flow** — what story beats and content flows next — not strictly by calendar day (Day 52, 51, 50…).
- **Days** = still used as timeline/countdown label (e.g. Day 50 of 52 → Finale March 20, 2026). Days inform the countdown and SYNTH price; they do **not** lock episode order. Episode order and "next episode" are driven by **flow**.
- **RUMOR episode** = flow-based episode. RUMOR HAS IT! — Chairman, Sammy and the gang already in town; Golden Backstage Awareness Pass. See EPISODES_BY_FLOW_NOT_DAYS_SNAP.md · EPISODE_RUMOR_CHAIRMAN_SAMMY_GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE.md.

### **Daily Episode Structure**

**Episode Length:** 30-60 minutes  
**Daily Release:** One episode per day for 52 days (ordering by **flow**; days as countdown label)  
**Finale:** Extended 90-minute finale on March 20, 2026

**Episode Structure:**
1. **Cold Open** (2-3 min): Hook, preview, countdown
2. **Act 1** (10-15 min): Main story, character development
3. **Act 2** (10-15 min): Conflict, challenges, development
4. **Act 3** (10-15 min): Resolution, transformation, happy ending
5. **Tag** (2-3 min): Countdown update, next episode preview. **That is tomorrow's episode — always tease new, laying the edge for today's seed.** See [EPISODE_TEASE_SEED_EDGE_SNAP.md](./EPISODE_TEASE_SEED_EDGE_SNAP.md).
