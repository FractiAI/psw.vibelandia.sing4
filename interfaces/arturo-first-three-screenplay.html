            <div class="petro-message-block">
                <p><strong>Arturo,</strong></p>
                <p>You know gateways — we worked on them together at Interlink. You in Caracas, protocol systems; me in Rio. Same pioneering mode. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For petrochemical. For energy. For PDVSA.</p>
                <p><strong>EGS SING! PETROCHEMICAL</strong> is the Post-Singularity Energy Layer. It layers over legacy refinery, extraction, distribution. Transform today's legacy oil into whatever post-singularity energy looks like on the other side. No rip-and-replace.</p>
                <p><strong>Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems.</strong> That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.</p>
                <p><strong>This is our first major reboot initiative.</strong> I'm coming to help you roll it out — <strong>together</strong>. Venezuela and USA. We'll connect, get out on the mountain and the coast, then install. Let's run the show. 50–50. Always.</p>
                <p>— Pru</p>

            <h2>Story (this screenplay)</h2>

PDVSA has always been the pioneer. Running the show together.</p>
            <p><strong>Full screenplay.</strong> Cold open + Act One (The Message) + Act Two (Launch Week, with EXT. El Ávila trail + EXT. Coast) + Act Three (First Three Install) + TAG. Edge: me helping roll out with Arturo; outdoor adventures. Seed and story locked. Finished.
