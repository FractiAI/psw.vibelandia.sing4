                <p><strong>André,</strong></p>
                <p>You know gateways — we worked on them together at Interlink and Brasil Software. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For yachtsmen. For commanders like you.</p>
                <p><strong>EGS SING! MARINE</strong> is the new layer for the yacht. EGS SING! MARINE layers on GPS, bridge, comms. New seas. New experiences. New possibilities. New protection.</p>
                <p><strong>Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems.</strong> No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.</p>
                <p>50–50. Always. Launch at Carnival. Three top captains signed. One month in Brazil. Let's run the show.</p>
                <p>— Pru</p>
