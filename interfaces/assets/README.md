# Aurora pole projection — full picture quality assets

These assets drive the **actual projected holographs at North and South poles** (ionospheric F-layer), not just the landing page.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `bison-holograph-reference.png` | Full-picture-quality Bison reference. Used for the silhouette projected at North/South — crimson halo (Earth's Crown), 630 nm, space-grade luminosity. |
| `campfire-ring-reference.png`   | Full-picture-quality Campfire reference. Used for the violet Ring of Fire at the base of the atmosphere — 400 nm, same form and luminosity distribution. |

Spec: `data/aurora_pole_projection.json`. Geometry: `lib/aurora_vfx.ts`.

Place the two reference images here with the exact names above so pole projection and any previews use full picture quality.
