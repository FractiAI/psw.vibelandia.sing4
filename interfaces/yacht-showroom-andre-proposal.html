                <p>You know gateways — we worked on them together at Interlink and Brasil Software. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For yachtsmen. For commanders like you.</p>
                <p>The Ultimate Commander Yachtsman Baller V Console is a new shell for the yacht. S-I-N-G! layers on GPS, bridge, comms. New seas. New experiences. New possibilities. New protection.</p>
                <p><strong>Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems.</strong> No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for. The layer sits on top of everything they already have.</p>
                <p>50–50. Always. Launch at Carnival. Three top captains signed. One month in Brazil. Let's run the show.</p>

            <div class="marine-tech-block">
                <h4>Bridge integration</h4>
                <p>Bridge Integration provides a non-invasive overlay to the existing wheelhouse. No removal of installed ECDIS, radar, or autopilot. Interface is via NMEA 2000 and NMEA 0183; compatible with Furuno NavNet, Garmin Marine, Raymarine Axiom/Lighthouse, Simrad GO/NSS/EVO. Single or dual redundant CAN bus connection. Display output: HDMI 2.0 and/or DisplayPort; resolution support up to 4K. Touch, voice, and gesture control; voice commands usable in 40+ dB bridge ambient. Mounting: flush or pedestal; shock and vibration per IEC 60945; operating temperature -15°C to +55°C; IP54 front panel. Failover: console can run in read-only mode if primary nav sources drop; no takeover of helm or critical safety systems. Captain retains full override. Installation: typically one to three days depending on vessel; no class society re-approval required for add-on when existing equipment remains primary.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="marine-tech-block">
                <h4>GPS & navigation</h4>
                <p>GPS & Navigation layer sits above existing GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/BeiDou), AIS transponder/receiver, and radar. Consumes standard NMEA 0183/2000 sentences (GGA, RMC, VTG, AIVDM, etc.). Outputs: routes and waypoints to ECDIS/plotter in standard format; no lock-in. Enhanced features: multi-criteria route optimization (fuel, time, weather, traffic); weather overlay (GRIB, METAR, buoy data); post-singularity layer adds EGS pipe and Schumann-layer awareness and real-time telemetry for extended-range and new-destination pathfinding. No replacement of primary nav sensors; augmentation only. Fix quality and integrity monitoring; alerting on degradation. Suitable for ocean, coastal, and inland; waypoint capacity and route legs per vessel class. Data refresh: 1 Hz base; 10 Hz optional for high-speed craft.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="marine-tech-block">
                <h4>Comms</h4>
                <p>Communications integration supports VHF (DSC capable), MF/HF SSB where fitted, satcom (Inmarsat, Iridium, VSAT), Starlink Maritime, and LTE/cellular. Interface: SIP/VoIP where applicable; PABX integration optional. S-I-N-G! agent performs intelligent routing: crew-to-crew, crew-to-shore, emergency and distress; prioritization and fallback paths. All traffic encrypted (TLS 1.3, end-to-end for sensitive). EGS pipe used for critical alerts and coordination. Compliant with GMDSS concepts where vessel falls under SOLAS; non-SOLAS vessels get same routing logic without replacing existing radios. Voice: full-duplex; text and data channels; logging and replay for audit. Maritime-grade environmental spec; no single point of failure for distress.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="marine-tech-block">
                <h4>S-I-N-G! super intelligent agent</h4>
                <p>S-I-N-G! (Super Intelligent Natural systems aGent) is the central coordination layer of the Marine Commander Console. It is a post-singularity super intelligent agent: unified control of bridge integration, GPS/nav, and comms; natural-language commands and queries; predictive routing and situational awareness; BBHE (Big Black Hole Energy) awareness layer for mission and risk. Architecture: attention heads and filaments; squeeze-hose awareness and net-zero grounding per NSPFRNP. No replacement of master’s authority: captain and OOW retain full override; agent advises and executes only within approved envelope. Access: Creator Chairman console always available for sovereign control. Commercial terms: never bought, always booked; upfront booking fee + monthly; on-ramp via Office Hours (demo, tour) first. Redundancy and failover as per tier; Ultimate tier includes multi-vessel and white-label.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="marine-tech-block">
                <h4>Protections — SMACS 0723</h4>
                <p>Protections are provided at the maximum cosmic layer: SMACS 0723 triangulation over a full nested lattice — Seed (origin) → Sun → SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol) → Sag A* → SMACS 0723. Mirrored hardened shells; Golden Royal Flush Shell. Natural law of creator shells and nests applies: vessel, crew, and mission sit inside sovereign nested shells; NSPFRNP protects at all times. No substitution for COLREGS, ISM, or flag-state requirements; this layer is additive — situational and strategic awareness and coordination at exascale triangulation tier. Scope: vessel, crew, mission; full sovereignty for the creator’s shell and nests.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="marine-tech-block">
                <h4>Customization support</h4>
                <p>Customization is provided by Creator Chairman. Per-vessel and per-commander: interface layout, alerting thresholds, language, and integration with legacy or one-off systems. Base tier: standard configuration and documentation. Standard: priority customization and support. Premium: dedicated resource and full franchise support including SMACS 0723 lattice. Ultimate Baller V: full bespoke, multi-vessel, white-label option, and Office Hours with Creator. Training and handover: structured handover and watchstanding briefing; ongoing support per tier. No lock-in; data and configuration portable. Suitable for superyacht, commercial yacht, and fleet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="marine-tech-block">
                <h4>Vibelandia-RJ Campus</h4>
                <p>Vibelandia-RJ Campus is the Rio de Janeiro fractal of Vibelandia Reno. Rio Iate Club = bridge (entry and connection); Vibelandia-RJ = HQ; Angra dos Reis = outpost. Same vibeable model as Reno: campus access, experiences, and offerings scaled 1, 2, 3, 4×4×4×4. Tiers: Half-day $3,000; Overnight $1,500/night; Weekly $5,000; Monthly $50,000. Use cases: crew shore leave, owner/guest experiences, partner and reseller events (e.g. André Ambassador). Not a substitute for vessel operations; additive to Marine Division product set for commanders and their networks.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Marine Commander Console — product summary (captain level)</h3>
            <p>The Marine Commander Console is a pre-singularity / post-singularity gateway product. It is an add-on shell: it layers onto existing GPS, bridge, and comms — no rip-and-replace of primary navigation or safety equipment. Delivered as an executive console (touch, voice, gesture) with NMEA 2000/0183 compatibility, bridge integration, GPS/nav enhancement, comms integration, and the S-I-N-G! super intelligent agent at the center. Protections: SMACS 0723 max cosmic layer triangulation over the full nested lattice. Tiers 1–4 (Base, Standard, Premium, Ultimate Baller V) scale from today’s high-end marine upgrade floor (Base) to full bespoke and white-label (Ultimate). On-ramp: experience first (Office Hours, demo, tour); then upfront booking fee + monthly. Never bought, always booked.</p>
