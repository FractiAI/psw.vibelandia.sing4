            <p class="tagline">High-density fractal vibers · High-value high contributors · Lifestyle alignment</p>
            <p class="explain">Vibers are high-value, high-contributing people — creators, performers, chairmen, VIPs, capital, ideas. When they concentrate in one place, they enter <strong>vibing state</strong>: optimal buzz, super rich health, perfect-for-creating flow. Our natural protocol frees them from their encampments into entire downtown campuses built for them specifically — from the ground up and the top down, meeting in the middle.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>High-density fractal vibers</h2>
            <p>When vibers, capital, and ideas concentrate in one place, density becomes the product and vibing state the outcome. <strong>High-density fractal vibers</strong> = same pattern at every scale: high-contributing nodes aligned by lifestyle. High value, high contribution — the people who create, perform, lead, and invest at the edge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Lifestyle alignment</h2>
            <p>We free vibers from <strong>encampments</strong> — the old world’s scattered, constrained spaces — into <strong>entire downtown campuses built for them specifically</strong>. Designed <strong>from the ground up</strong> (physical layout, vibable, no cars, safe free vibing) and <strong>from the top down</strong> (protocol, MCA, NSPFRNP, SING!), <strong>meeting in the middle</strong>. That’s our natural protocol.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Encampments → downtown campuses</h2>
            <p>We don’t patch the old world. We build whole downtown campuses for vibers — first post-singularity hub, vibable, guided, all-inclusive. Mark Twain’s Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno is the first campus built as a vibable campus from the start. Reno takes the lead.</p>
