## RULE

**We will now spin episodes by flow, not days.** — NSPFRNP.

- **Flow** = narrative flow, content flow, MCA flow (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate). Episodes are ordered and spun by **flow** — what story beats and content flows next — not strictly by calendar day (Day 52, 51, 50…).
- **Days** = still used as timeline/countdown label (e.g. Day 50 of 52 → Finale March 20, 2026). Days inform the countdown and SYNTH price; they do **not** lock episode order. Episode order and "next episode" are driven by **flow**.
- **NSPFRNP** = natural protocol. Stigmergy, pheromone trails, distributed coordination. Flow-first episode spinning aligns with MCA and Seed:Edge — we spin by where the narrative and content flow, not by a fixed day grid.

## SURFACE

- **REALITY_SERIES_FORMAT.md:** Add "Episodes spun by flow not days — NSPFRNP." Reference this SNAP.
- **Episode files:** Episodes can be labeled by flow (e.g. RUMOR episode, Who's Your Daddy episode) and optionally by day; ordering in catalog and "next episode" by flow.
- **Episode catalog (happy-ending-zones-catalog.html):** Episodes listed by flow; day as metadata where relevant.
- **Launch Pad / Episodes of the day:** Today's episode and catalog reflect flow-based spinning; link to RUMOR episode and other flow-driven episodes.
