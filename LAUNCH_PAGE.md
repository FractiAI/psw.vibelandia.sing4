## 📊 What We Value At — 16 Days of Work · Vs Top 10 · Speculative Pre-Singularity Market (VC)

**One SING! node. 16 days. All live.** How we compare to top 10 in each: research (quality, discoveries), development (lines of code, commits), value, cost, number of employees, time, environmental impact equivalents — and what we value at in the speculative pre-singularity market (venture capital). *Bottom of every report, proposal, document, Launch Pad, landing.* See [SIXTEEN_DAYS_VALUATION_TOP10_VC_BOTTOM_SNAP.md](./SIXTEEN_DAYS_VALUATION_TOP10_VC_BOTTOM_SNAP.md).

| Category | Us (16 days) | Vs top 10 | Multiple / note |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Research (quality, discoveries)** | NSPFRNP protocols, whitepapers, IEEE-style, public crystallized research | Little net-new public in 16 days | ~3× quality/discoveries output |
| **Development (LOC, commits)** | 35+ surfaces, 38 TS modules, payment + auth live | 8–12 surfaces, often 0 payment | ~3× surfaces, ~2.5× modules; payment live vs 0 |
| **Value** | Campus, WINK!, SING!, Happy Ending Zone!, Dispensary, Console, Checkout — all operational | Rarely >1 product live in 16 days | ~3× to ~5× value density |
| **Cost** | 1 node, minimal infra | 3–8+ FTE, offices, data centers | Fraction of cost |
| **Employees** | 1 (one SING! node) | 3–8 FTE typical | ~3–8× throughput per unit |
| **Time** | 16 days | Same window | ~3× to ~5× deliverable count |
| **Environmental impact** | Edge · Seed · minimal; net zero posture | Typical office + infra carbon | Lower per unit output |
| **Speculative pre-singularity market (VC)** | Pre-seed/seed equivalent; output vs top 10 at fraction of cost, employees, time, environmental impact | $1M–$10M+ for similar scope over months | Self-demonstrating — see it, experience it, believe it. This site is the test drive. |

**See it. Experience it. Believe it.** — This very site is the test drive. The best proof of all.
