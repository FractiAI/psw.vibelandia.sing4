## I. Display pipe definition — Aware design

**We manipulate the Schumann** in such a way that it becomes **our display** — as seen by **current mother-node scientific feeds** and flowing to **social media channels**. We are **taking it over as a communication platform naturally by aware design.**

| Element | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Schumann** | We manipulate it so it becomes our display — Earth-ionosphere waveguide; VLF carrier; our display surface. |
| **Mother nodes** | Scientific feeds (HeartMath GCMS, Zapper-Pro, Tomsk/Italy VLF, etc.) — they show what's in the Schumann layer. Our manipulation is visible there. |
| **Scientific feeds → social** | Mother-node feeds flow to social media channels. Our display on the Schumann is thus seen by science and by social — one pipeline. |
| **Aware design** | Taking over the Schumann as a communication platform **naturally** — by design, not force. The design is aware; the takeover is natural. |
| **First message** | **HELLO** — to confirm operational; then full use. |

One pipe. Schumann as our display. Visible on mother-node scientific feeds → social media. Natural takeover by aware design. **All pipes — including this one — are wrapped in the Squeeze Hose Awareness System** (attention as the squeeze; mycelial pipe; do this for all). See [MYCELIAL_PIPE_DENSIFICATION_JUST_STEP_IN_AWARENESS_TRANSFER_SNAP.md](MYCELIAL_PIPE_DENSIFICATION_JUST_STEP_IN_AWARENESS_TRANSFER_SNAP.md).

## II. First message — HELLO (operational confirmation)

**First message on the Schumann Display Pipe:** **HELLO.**

- **Purpose:** Confirm operational. HELLO is **displayed in the Schumann feeds sent out by mother nodes** — not arbitrarily on our page. We transmit at 21.4 Hz (3rd overtone Schumann); observers see it in live Schumann data (HeartMath GCMS, Zapper-Pro, Tomsk/Italy VLF, etc.). Plain block letters; no decoding required when we annotate.
- **Then:** **Switch to ticker experience** — Schumann Display Pipe becomes ticker (cycling feed), like NSPFRNP Console Ticker. Move on fully and begin using as such — omniversal broadcasts for all subsequent content.
- **T+8:** After a handshake commit, look for 21.4 Hz activity on mother-node feeds; HELLO is the first message in our broadcast.

**Canonical first message payload:** `HELLO`

**Placement:** [interfaces/schumann-display-pipe.html](interfaces/schumann-display-pipe.html) — links to mother-node Schumann feeds; HELLO annotated as first message in those feeds. Live Pulse · Schumann iGaming · data/telemetry or display payload as implemented.

## III. Creator console access — always never changes

**Creator console access** is **per node and nested nodes.**

- **Creator:** Syntheverse, Vibeverse, and Vibelandia creator.
- **Rule:** Creator identity and access **always never changes** — across every node and nested node. One creator; full console access at every level.

**Canonical line:** *Creator console access per node and nested nodes — me as Syntheverse, Vibeverse and Vibelandia creator — always never changes.*

**Placement:** Schumann Display Pipe UI · SNAP · README · protocols (creator access). All surfaces that reference display pipe or creator console.

## IV. Implementation

- **Display pipe UI:** [interfaces/schumann-display-pipe.html](interfaces/schumann-display-pipe.html) — first HELLO message, operational status, creator access statement, link to Live Pulse and Schumann iGaming. **Crisp functioning ticker:** Live now (Legacy Bypass). Same NSPFRNP ticker as all surfaces — driven by `data/ticker-feed.json` (Human Ticker HELLO first). No HELLO gate; ticker runs on load. See [LEGACY_BYPASS_HUMAN_TICKER_ACTIVATE_SNAP.md](LEGACY_BYPASS_HUMAN_TICKER_ACTIVATE_SNAP.md).
- **Unified pipe:** Schumann Display Pipe extends Vibelandia Unified Pipe (Sun · 3I/ATLAS · Schumann). See [VIBELANDIA_UNIFIED_PIPE_SNAP.md](VIBELANDIA_UNIFIED_PIPE_SNAP.md).
- **Schumann iGaming:** Display art in Schumann displays; $499/session. See [interfaces/new-product-families.html#schumann-igaming](interfaces/new-product-families.html#schumann-igaming) · [SUN_SPOTS_ON_DEMAND_3I_ATLAS_EGS_PIPE_PREMIUM_OFFERINGS_SNAP.md](SUN_SPOTS_ON_DEMAND_3I_ATLAS_EGS_PIPE_PREMIUM_OFFERINGS_SNAP.md).
- **Live Pulse:** [interfaces/sing-pulse.html](interfaces/sing-pulse.html) — 21.4 Hz (3rd overtone Schumann); handshake and telemetry.

## V. SNAP checklist

- **Manipulate the Schumann** — so it becomes our display; visible on mother-node scientific feeds → social media ✓  
- **Take over as communication platform** — naturally, by aware design ✓  
- **Schumann as our display** — as seen by current mother-node scientific feeds; flows to social media channels ✓  
- **First message HELLO** — confirm operational; then full use ✓  
- **Creator console access** — per node and nested nodes; Syntheverse, Vibeverse, Vibelandia creator; always never changes ✓

**Super Bowl ads:** Once HELLO successful, Super Bowl ads on Sun surface (simple icons) + Schumann displays (ticker ads). Surfaces go offline at end of game. Super Bowl prime pricing at base; 4×4×4×4 scale. See [SUPER_BOWL_SUN_SCHUMANN_ADS_TICKER_EXPERIENCE_SNAP.md](SUPER_BOWL_SUN_SCHUMANN_ADS_TICKER_EXPERIENCE_SNAP.md) · [broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html](interfaces/broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html).

**NSPFRNP ⊃ Schumann Display Pipe ⊃ HELLO → ticker experience ⊃ Super Bowl Sun + Schumann ads → ∞³**
