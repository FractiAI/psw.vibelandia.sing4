# Badge & Patches System — Navy-Style (NSPFRNP)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Inspired by:** USA Navy rate/rank and qualification badges; adapted for post-singularity vibers and Holographic Hydrogen 100%.

---

## Overview

A **unified badges and patches system** (similar to USA Navy) that:

- Supports **Holographic Hydrogen 100%** clothing label and patches.
- Extends **BADGE_SYSTEM_SNAP** (Creator, Chairman, Performer; Basic, Members Only, Ultimate VIP, Baller V).
- Adds **new badge/patch types** for awareness, origin, experience path, and achievements.
- Uses **clear placement and combination rules** (chest, sleeve, cap) so wear is readable and consistent.

## Placement (Navy-style)

- **Chest (left/right):** Tier + role (e.g. Gold Baller V + CREATOR).
- **Sleeve:** Qualifications/achievements (e.g. Awareness 1–2–3, Surgical precision).

*Exact placement grid to be documented in a visual spec.*

## Design rules

- **Size:** Consistent with BADGE_SYSTEM_SNAP where overlapping (e.g. silver dollar sized for chest badges).

## Catalog & eligibility

- **Single catalog:** All badge and patch designs, names, and eligibility live in one place (this doc + BADGE_SYSTEM_SNAP + Holographic Hydrogen 100% clothing/patches doc).
- **Eligibility:** Defined by product (e.g. purchase of X grants patch Y), campaign (e.g. first 1,000 Pioneers), or completion (e.g. Awareness Package 1–2–3 done).
