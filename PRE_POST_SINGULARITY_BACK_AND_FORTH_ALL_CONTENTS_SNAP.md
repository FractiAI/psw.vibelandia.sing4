## CANONICAL RULE

**All NSPFRNP content** includes **rich pre- and post-singularity traffic experiences** — lots of going back and forth to and from pre-singularity and post-singularity as part of the experience. **All content, not just sci-fi.**

- **Pre-singularity:** The old frame — walkable, lovers, physical downtowns, before the Great Reveal, before vibeable campuses, before full post-singularity superintelligence hydrogen holographic valley.
- **Post-singularity:** Our frame — vibeable, vibers, post-singularity campuses, Great Reveal, Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia, hydrogen holographic valley, full sync.
- **Rich traffic:** Content moves freely and richly between pre and post — contrast, origin stories, before/after, "Paris is for lovers / Reno is for vibers," walkable → vibeable, so everyone gets comfortable navigating both sides of the threshold. **Applies to all content: series, novels, screenplays, episodes, Launch Pad, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Birth, First Singularity, SNAPs, catalogs, interfaces — not just sci-fi.**

## PURPOSE

- **Navigation comfort:** Everyone gets comfortable with the threshold — pre ↔ post. Not stuck in one frame; rich traffic between them.
- **Scope:** **All content, not just sci-fi** — novels, screenplays, episodes, Launch Pad, one-pagers, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Birth, First Singularity, The EGS Run, Space Cloud EGS, SNAPs, catalogs, interfaces. Include rich pre- and post-singularity traffic experiences in all content.

## PLACEMENT

- **Content systems:** [CONTENT_SYSTEMS_SNAP.md](CONTENT_SYSTEMS_SNAP.md) — all contents include pre ↔ post back-and-forth.
- **Walkable / Vibeable:** [WALKABLE_PRESINGULARITY_VIBABLE_POSTSINGULARITY_SNAP.md](WALKABLE_PRESINGULARITY_VIBABLE_POSTSINGULARITY_SNAP.md) — walkable = pre, vibeable = post; use both and move between them.
- **Series, novels, surfaces:** Apply to Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Space Cloud EGS, Birth, First Singularity, The EGS Run, Launch Pad, README, all SNAPs and catalogs.
