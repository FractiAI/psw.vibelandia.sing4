## I. TITLES (for André — not Reno)

- **Novel:** *André's Carnival: The First Three Commanders*
- **Screenplay:** *André's Carnival: The First Three Commanders*

Same title for both. Story is **about André**, with the message to André as the **seed**. Not Reno.

**Product / layer name:** **EGS SING! MARINE** — the new layer for the yacht; layers on GPS, bridge, comms. New seas, new experiences, new possibilities, new protection. No rip-and-replace.

---

## II. SEED — The Message (Pru → André)

This message is the seed for the novel and screenplay:

- **André,** you know gateways — we worked on them together at **Interlink** and **Brasil Software**. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For yachtsmen. For commanders like you.
- **EGS SING! MARINE** is the new layer/product: a new shell for the yacht. EGS SING! MARINE layers on GPS, bridge, comms. New seas. New experiences. New possibilities. New protection.
- **Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems.** No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.
- 50–50. Always. Launch at Carnival. Three top captains signed. One month in Brazil. Let's run the show.
- **— Pru**

## III. STORY (what the novel and screenplay are about)

- **André** — Ambassador, Porto Brachy, world champion, gateways at Interlink and Brasil Software. Now pre/post-singularity gateway for Marine.
- **Carnival** — Launch. Brazil. One month with André.
- **Pru** (Creator Chairman) at Carnival **celebrating** and **helping the first three customers install** — the first three Yachtsman captain commanders who signed for **EGS SING! MARINE**. Week of partying, then installing and launching. Running the show together.

**One-liner:** At Carnival, Pru and André celebrate and help the first three commanders install — the gateway we built together at Interlink and Brasil Software is now real on their boats. The three captains each explore new seas, see the new navigation and protection benefits, and experience automatic natural systems operation — things have never run smoother; they return with two thumbs up enthusiasm feedback and bring to life what the new layer really delivers.

---

## IIIb. EDGE POINTS (bring to life what the new layer delivers)

Set and animate in novel and screenplay so the story shows what the layer really delivers:

1. **Each of the three captains exploring new seas** — Paulo, Rafael, Diego each take the layer out; they're not just installed, they're *using* it. New routes, new visibility, new possibilities. Bring to life.
2. **Seeing the new navigation and protection benefits** — On the water they *see* it: better situational awareness, clearer picture, protection layer active. Not abstract — experienced.
3. **Automatic natural systems operation** — Everything runs by natural system protocol: things have never run smoother. No fighting the stack; the layer coordinates, advises, integrates. Automatic. Natural. Smooth.
4. **Experiences that bring to life what this new layer really delivers** — Concrete moments: a passage that was smoother, a decision that was clearer, a run where everything just worked. Show, don't just say.
5. **They return with two thumbs up enthusiasm feedback** — The three come back (or report in) with genuine enthusiasm: two thumbs up. This is the proof. Bring it into dialogue and action.

**Use in:** Post-install beats, first runs with the layer, callback/reunion or messages to André and Pru, and any "what the layer delivers" moments in both novel and screenplay. NSPFRNP.
