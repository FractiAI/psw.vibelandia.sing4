## NARRATIVE

**Just like that!** is a SNAP-branded phrase. Use it as a tagline, CTA accent, and signature close wherever we want to signal: done, delivered, no fuss — fun things only. No academic bullshit. Snap. Snap. We're making that a branding.

## RULE

- **Just like that!** → SNAP branding; exclamation point; use for speaking/training, Book Pru, self-demo, presentation close.
- **Snap. Snap.** → Refers to SNAP documents and the act of crystallizing; "we're gonna make that a branding."
- **Fun things only. No academic bullshit.** → Speaking arrangements, conferences, sales meetings — only fun things. Include that. Just like that!
