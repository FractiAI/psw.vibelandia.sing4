## Tesla Gigafactory Nevada — Verified

**Location:** Storey County, Tahoe Reno Industrial Center  
**Scale:** 5.4 million sq ft; 5,000–9,999 employees (Storey County top employer)  
**Investment:** $6.2 billion to date; $3.6B expansion (100 GWh battery + first Semi factory)

---

## Output

Lithium-ion battery packs · EV components (motors, drivetrains) · Tesla Powerwall · Tesla Semi assembly

**Automation:** Robotic arms, conveyor lines, autonomous vehicles. "Machine that builds the machine." Optimus production shifting to Fremont; Nevada remains battery and drivetrain hub.

## SING! Opportunity

Physical proof that Reno is the robotic factory hub. Supply chain and suppliers in region. Nevatio serves Tesla suppliers; Kerrigan team built Tesla robot control platforms. SING! Omnispin = next evolution of that stack — describe it, execute it; no manual path programming. Reno solidifies as Post-Singularity Superintelligence AI Valley.
