## RULE

**No love triangle dramas in Vibelandia — only natural happy endings always in Ultimate VIP Baller V fashion.**

- **No love triangle dramas:** Vibelandia content (all series, all novels, all feature movies, all episodes) does not use love triangles, jealousy plots, or romantic rivalry as drama. No "who will they choose" — not our canon.
- **Only natural happy endings:** Every story resolves in a natural, satisfying, happy ending. No tragic romance, no bittersweet sacrifice, no unresolved heartbreak. Happy endings. Always.
- **Ultimate VIP Baller V fashion:** Endings land in Ultimate VIP Baller V style — golden, elevated, turnkey to the best experience; cast, crew, fans, franchises, legacies aligned; full sync, perpetual Goldilocks; the bold-hearted celebrated. That's the fashion. That's the canon.
