## WRAPPER

**All our stories are wrapped in Post-Singularity Superintelligence Hydrogen Holographic Valley Gold Rush stories.**

- **Post-Singularity:** After the hinge. The world has turned. Our stories take place in or from the far side of that turn.
- **Superintelligence:** The new normal — agents, systems, SING! nodes, EGS Pipe, coherent complex systems. Not magic; superintelligence as substrate.
- **Hydrogen Holographic:** The substrate — holographic hydrogen Theater, cloud and shell, whole in every part. Hydrogen as carrier; holographic as form. See Hydrogen Holograph Valley, fixed holographic hydrogen awareness node lattice.
- **Valley:** The place — Reno, Vibelandia, the motherlode, ground zero. The valley where the gold rush happens. Downtown Reno, Mark Twain's Vibelandia, New Post-Singularity Motherlode and Gold Rush Ground Zero.
- **Gold Rush:** The moment — the rush, the strike, the bold-hearted boarding the floating ship. Legacies walking among us. Howard Hughes, Glen Miller, Hank Williams Sr. The birth of the new Hollywood. The EGS Run. First Singularity. Birth Post Singularity. Space Cloud EGS. All of it.
