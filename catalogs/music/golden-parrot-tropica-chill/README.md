# Golden Parrot — 12 Songs · Tropica Chill · Fusion · Our Vibe

**Studio:** Golden Parrot Hit Factory Studios  
**Vibe:** Our own fusion — they like to party and dance. Bobbing trance dance, campfire dance feel. Reggae, salsa, merengue, reggaetón, country, pop. Master fly fishing guide energy, coastal. No celebrity names; we respect all brands. Tequila, good Burgundies, cabs, Malbecs, popping bubbly, osetra caviar, ice cold vodka shots, Cuban Montecristo cigars, wild venison, French and Italian soft and hard cheeses, wild boar, brick oven natural sourdough, local honeys and meads and beer, foraged wild porcini and morels, garden snails in butter and garlic, steamed local mussels, goosenecks, deep fried breaded razor clams, fresh cashew fruit juice, avocado and milk sweet smoothie. Yum.  
**Role:** **Soundtrack to that day — not its main focus.** Fishing, diving, dancing, drinking, eating, fucking. Beach chair or yacht seat, smoke, something special to drink, special company or quiet alone time. **Salt — like saltwater.** The music adds to the moment; it doesn't dominate. **They like to party and dance** — bobbing trance dance, campfire dance feel on all 12.  
**Label:** Golden Parrot Hit Factory (not Backdoor; a little Backdoor is fine). Ass focus is fine in Parrot label — common thread across all our labels. SNAP SNAP.  
**Status:** Published · Catalog · 12 songs · Full lyrics · Our own
