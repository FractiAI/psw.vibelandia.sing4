## LYRICS (full)

**INTRO:**  
The pool below — I know the way  
Steamed mussels, razor clams — Golden Parrot stay

**VERSE 1:**  
There's a dock and a light and a line in the water  
Garden snails in butter and garlic — son and daughter  
Foraged wild porcini and morels — in the pan  
The pool below — Golden Parrot man  
Reggae slow, salsa sweet — merengue home  
The pool below — we're not alone

**CHORUS:**  
The pool below — mussels · clams · snails  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — no fails  
Porcini and morels — that's the call  
The pool below — one and all

**VERSE 2:**  
Reno or the coast — same home in the chest  
Legacies with us — we're blessed  
Deep fried breaded razor clams — goosenecks in the steam  
The pool below — same dream  
French and Italian cheeses — soft and hard  
The pool below — we're the card

**CHORUS:**  
The pool below — mussels · clams · snails  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — no fails  
Porcini and morels — that's the call  
The pool below — one and all

**OUTRO:**  
The pool below. Golden Parrot. Our vibe. Home.
