## LYRICS (full)

**INTRO:**  
Deck drinks — on the rail  
Tequila, Burgundies, cabs — Golden Parrot sail

**VERSE 1:**  
Tequila in the glass — sun on the water  
Good Burgundies below — master guide daughter  
Cabs and Malbecs — red in the shade  
Popping bubbly when we hit the bay  
Reggae groove, salsa clave — merengue light  
Deck drinks — we go with the flow, we're right

**CHORUS:**  
Deck drinks — tequila · Burgundies · cabs · Malbecs  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — no flex  
Bubbly in the ice — Golden Parrot style  
Deck drinks — mile after mile

**VERSE 2:**  
Reno river or the open sea  
Deck drinks — we're free  
Ice cold vodka shots — one for the crew  
Local honeys, meads, and beer — we're true  
French and Italian cheeses on the board  
Deck drinks — clink, clink — we're on the same chord

**CHORUS:**  
Deck drinks — tequila · Burgundies · cabs · Malbecs  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — no flex  
Bubbly in the ice — Golden Parrot style  
Deck drinks — mile after mile
