## LYRICS (full)

**INTRO:**  
Midstream — still at sea  
Montecristo and good cheese — Golden Parrot free

**VERSE 1:**  
Twenty years of water — twenty years of sky  
Cuban Montecristo — smoke rise high  
French and Italian — soft and hard upon the board  
Midstream — master guide lord  
Wild venison and wild boar — we're still at the table  
Reggae slow, salsa warm — merengue able

Midstream — Montecristo · cheese  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — at ease  
Venison and boar — Golden Parrot way  
Midstream — we stay

**VERSE 2:**  
Legacies beside us — living men  
Good Burgundies, cabs, Malbecs — again, again  
Brick oven sourdough — break the bread  
Midstream — we're fed  
Post-singularity — full reality  
Midstream — that's the quality

**CHORUS:**  
Midstream — Montecristo · cheese  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — at ease

Midstream — we stay
