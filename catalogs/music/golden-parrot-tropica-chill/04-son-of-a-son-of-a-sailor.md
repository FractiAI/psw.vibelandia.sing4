## LYRICS (full)

**INTRO:**  
The bend in the river — blood and sea  
Steamed local mussels — Golden Parrot free

**VERSE 1:**  
Down to the water — the bend in the river  
Goosenecks, daughter — cold clear run  
Steamed local mussels — garlic, butter, wine  
Deep fried breaded razor clams — Golden Parrot line  
Reggae tide, salsa moon — merengue beat  
The bend in the river — we eat, we eat

**CHORUS:**  
The bend in the river — mussels and clams  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — no sham  
Goosenecks in the pot — razor clams in the fry  
Golden Parrot — harbour high, harbour high

**VERSE 2:**  
Garden snails smothered in butter and garlic — slow  
Foraged wild porcini and morels — we know  
Legacies on the deck — living men  
The bend in the river — again, again  
Coastal chill — our vibe at sea  
Golden Parrot — we're free, we're free

**CHORUS:**  
The bend in the river — mussels and clams  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — no sham  
Goosenecks in the pot — razor clams in the fry  
Golden Parrot — harbour high, harbour high

**OUTRO:**  
The bend. River. Mussels. Clams. Golden Parrot. Sea.
