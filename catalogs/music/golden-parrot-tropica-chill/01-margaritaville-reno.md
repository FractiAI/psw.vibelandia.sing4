## LYRICS (full)

**INTRO:**  
First light on the river — tequila on the rail  
Cold clear water · Golden Parrot · we don't fail

**VERSE 1:**  
Waders on, rod in hand — reggae slow  
Salsa in the pocket when the trout go  
Good Burgundies back at the lodge, cabs in the shade  
Malbecs for the wild boar — master guide made  
Fly fishing morning — coastal bend  
First light on the river — we meet you there, friend

**CHORUS:**  
First light on the river — tequila · cold clear run  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal, country-rock for real  
One more cast — Golden Parrot way  
Reno sun — we stay, we stay

**VERSE 2:**  
Popping bubbly when the legacies land  
Ice cold vodka shots — hand to hand  
Brick oven natural sourdough — break the bread  
French and Italian cheeses — soft and hard — we're fed  
Drift and rise — tropica beat  
First light on the river — full circle complete

**CHORUS:**  
First light on the river — tequila · cold clear run  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal, country-rock for real  
One more cast — Golden Parrot way  
Reno sun — we stay, we stay

**OUTRO:**  
First light. River. Golden Parrot. Our vibe. Stay.
