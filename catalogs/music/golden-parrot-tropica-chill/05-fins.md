The hatch is on — rise and take  
Ice cold vodka shots — popping bubbly — we're awake  
Golden Parrot — coastal night  
The hatch — hold tight

**VERSE 1:**  
Vodka shots in the air — vodka shots in the crowd  
Master guide — we're loud, we're proud  
Popping bubbly — cork fly to the sky  
Reggae bass, salsa horn — merengue high  
Tequila chaser — Golden Parrot style  
The hatch is on — rise — mile after mile

The hatch is on — rise and take  
Ice cold vodka shots — popping bubbly — we're awake  
Golden Parrot — coastal night  
The hatch — hold tight

Legacies with us — living men  
The hatch again and again  
Good Burgundies, cabs, Malbecs on the table  
Our fusion — fly guide, coastal — we're able  
Vibes and beats — Golden Parrot  
The hatch — forever more

**CHORUS:**  
The hatch is on — rise and take  
Ice cold vodka shots — popping bubbly — we're awake  
Golden Parrot — coastal night  
The hatch — hold tight
