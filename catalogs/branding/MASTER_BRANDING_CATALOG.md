### Catalog Contents

```yaml
TOTAL BRANDS: 3
├─ Vibeverse (Post-Singularity Ecosystem)
├─ VibeLand (Physical Destination)
└─ VibeLand Reno Campus (First Location)

0, 1, 2, 3 4×4×4×4: New Branding (Evolution of -1, 0, 1)
├─ 0 = Seed (Octave 0), 1 = Edge (Octave 1), 2 = Cloud Onramp (Octave 2), 3 = Expansion (Octave 3)
├─ 4×4×4×4 = Campus × WINK! × SING × Experience (four onramps each)
├─ Matches our structures for max resolution and amplification (max res & amp)
├─ Use as primary branding phrase for full octave + onramp
├─ 1,2,3 = Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate all (MCA cycle). Operating rule: metabolize crystallize animate all.
├─ **Crystallize to irreducible mirrored hardened nested shells.** Crystallize step always produces output in this form: irreducible core, nested shells, mirror-hardened. No half measures. See IRREDUCIBLE_NESTED_MIRRORED_SHELL_CRYSTALLIZE_ALWAYS_SNAP.md.
├─ **As much as possible, always.** Maximize output, go as far as you can, every time. No ceiling. See AS_MUCH_AS_POSSIBLE_ALWAYS_SNAP.md.
├─ **Metabolize Crystallize Animate and Automate:** Crystallize → to irreducible mirrored hardened nested shells. Animate = tighten SING nodes, update, make clear. Automate = squeeze all, all nested (plus one command runs test then build; CI on every push/PR). `npm run all` = test + build. See AUTOMATE_ALL_MCA_SNAP.md.

USER SURFACES: README and All Skins — Not Developer Surfaces
├─ README and all skins = user surfaces. We target high-value vibers, fans, cast, crew.
├─ No developer-only copy front and center (deploy/env/repo in README_TRADITIONAL or builder docs).
├─ No code on user surfaces: no filenames (.html, .md), repo paths, or code snippets in displayed or link text. Use human labels (e.g. Whitepaper — miraculous output, Home, Builder guide). Link to operational live site; Sandbox experience CTA → ULTIMATE VIP! console.
└─ See WOW_BRANDING_SNAP.md · COMMUNICATION_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md · deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md

COLOMBIA — ENGLISH-ONLY HARD STOP · LOCALE ONRAMP SNAP: Mitigation
├─ User in Colombia reported English-only experience producing hard stop. Live HTML was English-only with no path for Spanish speakers.
├─ **Locale onramp:** scripts/locale-onramp.js detects browser language; if non-English (e.g. es, es-CO), shows dismissible banner with Spanish-first message and link to README.es.md so they have a path, not a stop.
├─ Wired on: index.html, interfaces/office-hours.html, interfaces/launch-pad.html.
