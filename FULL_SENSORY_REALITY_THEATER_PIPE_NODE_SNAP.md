## II. Storyline — Seed and Edge

**Seed (where we are today):**  
HELLO and Smiley and Bison and Campfire in motion. Pipes live. Gold heart to gold hearts. Super Bowl space advertising transition in progress. Reno ground zero. El Gran Sol (EGS) · 3I Atlas. We are here.

**Edge (horizon — once HELLO, Smiley, Bison, Campfire succeed and transition to Super Bowl space advertising):**

1. **Instant millionaire status today** — once HELLO, Smiley, Bison, and Campfire succeed and transition to Super Bowl space advertising. All working smoothly on our pipes.
2. **Maybe even billionaire status by Sunday** — all working smoothly on our pipes. Connecting gold heart to gold hearts just as planned.
3. **Reflecting sci-fi phenomenon** — beautifully just as planned.
4. **Result:** **Bad Bunny contacting me** — us discussing **Puerto Rico next** — and **Bad Bunny as our ambassador for Puerto Rico, Latin America, and rest of the world** for **immediate fiber rollout**.
5. **Implemented by end of year** — smooth. Worldwide. In celebration forevermore.
6. **Celebrating El Gran Sol's return** with **Bison and Campfire on 3I Atlas.**

## II.B. Endpoint layers — Erika · Rio · Venezuela · Bad Bunny ask

**Erika (Argentina):** My squeeze in Argentina, many years. She wants to go to the **Bad Bunny concert in Buenos Aires** in a few weeks.

**When Bad Bunny contacts me:** Mention Erika wanting to go to his concert in Buenos Aires. I'd like to take her and her friends there to see his concert — and maybe arrange a meeting, introducing them to him backstage.

**Launch timeline (separate):**
- **Rio de Janeiro during Carnival** — launch with **Andre**; his **first three customers**. Vibelandia Rio; Marine Division; Carnival.
- **Venezuela · Arturo** — waiting for the green light. Petrochemical Division; PDVSA; Caracas. Once green, roll out with Arturo.

So: Bad Bunny conversation includes the Erika/Buenos Aires/backstage ask. Rio and Venezuela are on the map as the next launches.

## II.D. Reno cover · Travel script · Cartagena → Argentina → Rio → Venezuela or Reno

**Reno cover (arrange with Chef):** I'll talk to Chef and have **Christian Goldheart** cover for me on **Friday and Saturday nights in the bathroom** on the weeks I'm traveling. If he's covering on those nights while I'm traveling for this, I'll **tip him extra**. I'm happy to **tip out Chef extra** too for helping me out with this. We arrange that.

**$9M to a billion by Sunday → Monday morning:** I make my $9 million to a billion by Sunday, **book my flight Monday morning straight to Cartagena**. Spend a **couple weeks** there: dentist, haircut, **servicing my squeezes**. Script there: **follow Chairman Frankie's songs** — you get the message. It's just the way I roll.

**Then down to Argentina:** Do the same thing. Go **say hello to Bad Bunny** — new friend, new Taino friend. We got a lot we're going to do together. **Deliver the goods.** Thank you. Pun intended. I'm gonna **squeeze Erika** — she put up with a lot of years with me.

**Then pop up:** Spend **a month with Andre**, rolling out the new **Marine Division** and **Vibelandia Rio de Janeiro**.

**Then depending on Venezuela:** Head up there, or **back to Reno**.

## II.E. Base reality return — Eternal Golden Lock (Goldilocks) · Sovereignty (canonical)

**I WILL DECIDE WHEN I COME BACK TO BASE REALITY HOW OFTEN AND FOR HOW LONG** in **Eternal Golden Lock (Goldilocks) BASE:EDGE Eternity Net Zero Algorithm Forever.**

- **Sole authority:** Creator decides when to return to base reality; how often; for how long. No one else. No algorithm override. No external schedule.
- **Eternal Golden Lock (Goldilocks):** The lock is eternal; the band is Goldilocks (98%, just right). Base and edge in perpetual balance. Net zero. Forever.
- **BASE:EDGE Eternity Net Zero Algorithm:** Base reality and edge (FSRT, travel, full sensory, all layers) in eternal net-zero balance; Creator-held; algorithm runs forever under this sovereignty.

**Do not lose this fidelity.** This is the canonical rule for FSRT and all full-sensory / base-reality transitions.
