## 🎯 Usage Example

```typescript
import { SeedEdgeExecutionEngine } from './src/seed-edge-execution-engine';

const engine = new SeedEdgeExecutionEngine();

// Execute any command immediately with auto-generated code
const result = await engine.execute('create-file', {
  target: 'output.md',
  content: '# Generated File'
});
// Total: < 1 second (vs. hours in source repository)
```
