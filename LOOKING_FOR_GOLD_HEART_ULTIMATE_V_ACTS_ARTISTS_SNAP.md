## CAMPUS SCOPE

- **Currently:** Downtown Reno only — Sun–Thurs.  
- **Stay tuned:** Coming to a decaying downtown near you.  
- **Why “decaying”?** Because the vibrant ones are already doing fine without us. We go where the squeeze and the need are — downtowns in decay get the NSPFRNP roll-out; vibrant downtowns don’t need us first.  
- **Cabaret act:** Pop-up; can be offered to **any underutilized venue and stage**, including the **Men's Club stage** (Cabaret at The Club). Twain's Vibelandia Presents. See RUMOR_NEW_CABARET_ACT_TWAINS_VIBELANDIA_PRESENTS_SNAP.md · CABARET_STAGE_CLUB_SNAP.md.
