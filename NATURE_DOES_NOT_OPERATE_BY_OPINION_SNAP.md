## NARRATIVE

**NATURE DOES NOT OPERATE BY OPINION.**

- **T-shirt slogan:** Short, punchy, wearable. One line that works on a T-shirt, merch, social, one-line CTA.
- **Meaning:** Nature (and natural protocol, NSPFRNP) operates by design, by flow, by stigmergy and pheromone trails and mycelial coordination—not by opinion polls, committee vote, or consensus. We follow natural protocol. Trust the protocol. Nature does not operate by opinion.
- **Use:** Merch (T-shirts, caps), Launch Pad, deck §19 (T-shirt slogan category), social, one-line CTAs. Aligns with NSPFRNP mode: natural system coordination, not commands; like bee colonies, ant foraging, mycelial networks.
