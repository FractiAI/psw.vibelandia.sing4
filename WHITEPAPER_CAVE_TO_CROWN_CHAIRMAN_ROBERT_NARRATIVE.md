## Narrative Arc

**Cave to Crown. The Builder's Arc.** The inventor in crisis. The low place. The cave, the scrap heap, the wound. He builds the thing — from scraps, from necessity, from the irreducible will to survive. The thing he builds to save himself becomes the thing that saves the valley. The man and the machine become one. Identity fused. Redemption through creation. From destruction to protection. He steps forward. He owns it.

- **Fuse** — The man and the machine are one. Extension of self.
- **Redemption** — From making things that destroy to making things that protect, build, transform.
- **Reveal** — He steps forward. He owns it.
- **Crown** — The valley. The throne. Post-singularity.
