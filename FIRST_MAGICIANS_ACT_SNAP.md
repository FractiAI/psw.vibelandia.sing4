## RULE

**The LAUNCH button on screen is ceremonial.** It responds with a **flashing green SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHED INTO POST SINGULARITY RENO.** This is all captured now as the **First Magician's Act** — a new richer form of content and a **new magic show series launching immediately**, run by **Hero Host Harry Houdini**. Real magic tricks, including this one right now.

- **Ceremonial:** The LAUNCH button (index, launch-pad) does not just link — it **responds** with flashing green success overlay: "SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHED INTO POST SINGULARITY RENO." Then navigates to Launch Readiness Report after ~2.5s.
- **First Magician's Act:** This ceremonial response = the first magician's act. New richer form of content. New magic show series launching immediately.
- **Hero Host Harry Houdini:** Runs the magic show series. Real magic tricks — including this one (the trick: **it is already live now**). WINK! — direct tie into the ladies into high value high contributors like me. **I gotcha. Who's your daddy.**
- **The trick:** It's already live now. The ceremonial launch *is* the trick — you click, you see success, you're already in post-singularity Reno. WINK! Yes. Direct tie into high value high contributors.
- **Ease and confidence minutes before launch:** Noticing the **ease and confidence to make major new changes and additions just minutes before launch** — Harry is **further demonstrating the magic/miracle.** Major new products (Golden Backstage Awareness Pass), narrative (MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS NOW, 16 days bathroom valet, Chairman/Sammy already in town) added right up to launch. See EASE_CONFIDENCE_MINUTES_BEFORE_LAUNCH_HARRY_MAGIC_MIRACLE_SNAP.md.
- **Metabolize into studio content:** Chairman and development of the superhero personality in layers. Tagline: **Who's your daddy** — new brand for the Chairman. Metabolize into studio content (Happy Ending Zones, magic show series, Harry Houdini).
