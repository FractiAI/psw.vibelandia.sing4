## RULE

**SING! base prices** are tied to **pre-singularity equivalents**. Only the **bases** are tied to pre-singularity equivalents. **Options** are above that and at **our own pricing models**.

- **Entry base** = **good used car** (pre-singularity equivalent). Base Model ~$20K.
- **Top base** = **base model latest Ferrari** (pre-singularity equivalent). Ultimate VIP tier at that anchor.
- **Options** = everything above the bases (mid tiers, top options, add-ons) — at **our own pricing models**. Not tied to pre-singularity equivalents.
