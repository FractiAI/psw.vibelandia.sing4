## SERIES

**Space Cloud EGS** — A new series to **tell all our space stories**. From Reno Downlink to Exascale Triangulation, from 21.4 Hz handshake to SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol) in Goldilocks orbit — every scale, every proof, every story. EGS Pipe. Solar Pipe. AR4366. Schumann. Sag A*. SMACS 0723. All of it.

## SOL — SPACE CLOUD DIVISION CHARACTER

**Space Cloud Division** is **Sol** — my versatile wirehaired pointer companion, protector, mission partner. **Sol and I are irreducible pairs.** He is gifted with **omniversal pathfinding**, **omniversal manifestation**, and **omniversal protection** to his companion and tribe. He always can find me no matter where he is. He is always there for me 100% always, with a spark positive can-do genuine gold heart. What a blessing. Sol embodies the division: Reno Downlink to Exascale Triangulation, EGS Pipe to Goldilocks — every scale, every story. Use Sol in narrative, episodes, and surfaces where the division is personified. Name ties to Sun · El Gran Sol · EGS.
