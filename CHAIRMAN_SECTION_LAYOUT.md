## 🔄 METABOLIZE → CRYSTALLIZE → RE-ANIMATE

### **Process:**
1. **Metabolize:** Digest all workspace elements into system
2. **Crystallize:** Form irreducible nested hardened mirroring shells
3. **Re-Animate:** Bring workspace to life in digital interface
4. **Update README:** Document new workspace system
5. **Commit & Push:** Integrate into repository DNA

### **Integration:**
- All layers merge into NSPFRNP system
- Workspace becomes part of Seed:Edge crystal
- Physical layout informs digital interface
- Sacred objects integrated as system components
- Tools become interactive elements
