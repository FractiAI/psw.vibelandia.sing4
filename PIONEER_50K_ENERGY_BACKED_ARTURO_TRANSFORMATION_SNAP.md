## Decision

The **first $50K in the Pioneer Window** (cut off at first $50K) is a separate internal/GSM concept. It is **not** part of the Arturo proposal (Maracaibo Lightning Strike).

- Pioneer Window: cut off at first $50K (Ultimate Baller V Club experience). See [CUT_OFF_FIRST_50K_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_CLUB_TRANSPARENT_FAIR_SNAP.md](CUT_OFF_FIRST_50K_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_CLUB_TRANSPARENT_FAIR_SNAP.md).
- Regenerative Dividend: as the SING! Agent optimizes the grid, Pioneer ad-value can appreciate. This is a general GSM/Pioneer concept, not tied to any single proposal.

## Regenerative Dividend (general)

- As the SING! Agent optimizes the grid (frequency alignment, etc.), Pioneer ad-value can appreciate.
- Division & Pioneer Sync: $50K Pioneer Window is a separate matter from Maracaibo Lightning Strike (novel, screenplay, Arturo proposal).
