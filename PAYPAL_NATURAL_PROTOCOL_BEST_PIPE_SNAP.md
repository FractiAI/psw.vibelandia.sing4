## BRAND

**PayPal** = our **natural protocol** has identified it as the **best pipe** for payment. **Trust the protocol!**

- **Why only PayPal (for now):** Our natural protocol self-selected them. They have helped us through **all aspects of our startup**. **Two thumbs up. PayPal only and proudly.** We don't add payment options by committee — we follow the protocol. One pipe, one flow, maximum clarity.
- **Usage:** Use this framing on checkout, Launch Pad, lottery promo, and any surface that explains payment. Hero Harry says: "Press the blue PayPal button and watch the miracle magic happen." Then: "Our natural protocol self-selected them — they have helped us through all aspects of our startup. Two thumbs up. PayPal only and proudly." Also: "Trust the protocol!" See HERO_HARRY_PRESS_BLUE_PAYPAL_MIRACLE_MAGIC_SNAP.md.
- **T-shirt-grade:** *Trust the protocol!* · *Two thumbs up. PayPal only and proudly.* — T-shirt slogan grade (see T-SHIRT SLOGAN content category).

## RULE

- **Payment pipe** = identified by **natural protocol** as **best pipe**. Only PayPal (for now) because the protocol says so.
- **Trust the protocol!** = closing phrase. Use on checkout and payment copy.
- **No apology** — we're not "only offering PayPal until we add more." We're offering the pipe the protocol chose. Trust the protocol!
