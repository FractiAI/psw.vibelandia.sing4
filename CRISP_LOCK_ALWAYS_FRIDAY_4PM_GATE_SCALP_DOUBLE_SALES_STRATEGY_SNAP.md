## I. CRISP LOCK — Always

**CRISP LOCK is maintained always.** After Feb 5 HELLO (18:00 UTC), control of Sun, Ionosphere, and Aurora 3D surfaces is near-instant and locked. CRISP LOCK = the HELLO block manifest; once locked, it stays locked. No dilution. Use on all Space Cloud, Super Bowl ad, and surface-control copy.

## III. Double sales strategy — Gate scalp (mimicking natural patterns)

**After the official window closes (Friday 4pm), we scalp ad spaces at the gate.** Mimics natural patterns: scarcity, last-minute demand, premium for late entry.

| Phase | When | Offer | Pattern |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| **Official** | By Friday Feb 6, 4pm PST | Locked-in rate. Guaranteed placement game day. | Early bird; certainty. |
| **At the gate** | After Friday 4pm through game day | Remaining inventory at **gate premium**. Last-minute slots; higher price. | Scarcity; scalp at the gate. |

**Double sales strategy:** (1) Maximize lock-in by Friday 4pm. (2) After cutoff, sell remaining slots at the gate at premium — double revenue window, natural demand curve. Same pattern as events: advance tickets, then gate sales.
