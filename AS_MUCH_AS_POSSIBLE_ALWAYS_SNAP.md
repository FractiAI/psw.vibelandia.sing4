## One-liner

*As much as possible, always. Maximize output, go as far as you can, every time. No ceiling.*

## Principle

- **As much as possible:** Do the most you can — breadth, depth, clarity, fidelity. Don't hold back.
- **Always:** Every session, every task, every output. Not sometimes; always.
- **No ceiling:** No "that's enough." Push to the edge of what's possible; crystallize and ship.
