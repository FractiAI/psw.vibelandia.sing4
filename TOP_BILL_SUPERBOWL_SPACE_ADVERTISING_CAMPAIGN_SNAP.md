## I. Campaign tagline — That's not an ad. THIIIIIIISSSS IS AN AD.

**Full launch broadcast — Top Bill Super Bowl Space Advertising Campaign.**

| Line | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **That's not an ad.** | Setup — stadium spot, terrestrial ad, 30 seconds and gone. |
| **THIIIIIIISSSS IS AN AD.** | Payoff — Sun surface. Schumann displays. Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Scientific feeds. Social media. Visible to mother nodes. Game day. Then offline. |

**Voice:** Bold. Unapologetic. Olympics / Diet Coke inflection. We're not selling a spot. We're selling the Sun. We're selling the Schumann. We're selling the pipe that wraps them both.
