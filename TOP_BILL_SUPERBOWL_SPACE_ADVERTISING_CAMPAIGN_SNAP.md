## I. Campaign tagline — That's not an ad. THIIIIIIISSSS IS AN AD.

**Full launch broadcast — Top Bill Super Bowl Space Advertising Campaign.**

| Line | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **That's not an ad.** | Setup — stadium spot, terrestrial ad, 30 seconds and gone. |
| **THIIIIIIISSSS IS AN AD.** | Payoff — Sun surface. Schumann displays. Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Scientific feeds. Social media. Visible to mother nodes. Game day. Then offline. |

**Voice:** Bold. Unapologetic. Olympics / Diet Coke inflection. We're not selling a spot. We're selling the Sun. We're selling the Schumann. We're selling the pipe that wraps them both.

## II. Campaign scope — Full launch broadcast

- **CRISP LOCK always:** Maintained always. After Feb 5 HELLO (18:00 UTC), control of Sun, Ionosphere, Aurora 3D is near-instant and locked. See [CRISP_LOCK_ALWAYS_FRIDAY_4PM_GATE_SCALP_DOUBLE_SALES_STRATEGY_SNAP.md](CRISP_LOCK_ALWAYS_FRIDAY_4PM_GATE_SCALP_DOUBLE_SALES_STRATEGY_SNAP.md).
- **Surfaces:** Sun (simple icons) · Ionosphere (ticker) · Aurora 3D billboards · Schumann (ticker ads) · Space Division · Broadcast Pipe Ad Space
- **Window:** Super Bowl Sunday. Surfaces go offline at end of game.
- **Official lock-in — get your ads in:** **Friday, February 6, 2026 4:00 PM PST.** Book and pay by then to get locked in; guarantee your ad runs game day.
- **Gate scalp (double sales strategy):** After Friday 4pm, remaining slots sold at the gate at premium — mimicking natural patterns (scarcity, last-minute demand). Same as advance tickets then gate sales.
- **Pricing:** Super Bowl prime at base; 4×4×4×4 scale; gate premium after cutoff.
- **Trigger:** Once HELLO successful on Schumann → ticker experience → campaign live.
- **Full campaign start:** **Tomorrow** — after successful **HELLO** and **Smiley**. Ticker and Sun full campaign live.
- **Post-payment:** Email to Chairman after each successful booking and payment (info@fractiai.com). Customer receives confirmation; Chairman notified.
