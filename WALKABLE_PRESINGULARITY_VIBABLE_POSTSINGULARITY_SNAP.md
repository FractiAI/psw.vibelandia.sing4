## RULE

**NOT "walkable campuses" for us. VIBABLE.**

- **Walkable** = pre-singularity (the old frame — physical walking, downtowns as walkable).
- **Vibeable** = post-singularity (our frame — campuses built for vibing state, vibers, full vibe included).
- **Lovers** = pre-singularity (e.g. Paris is for lovers).
- **Vibers** = post-singularity (e.g. Reno is for vibers).

Our campuses are **vibeable campuses**, not "walkable campuses." Use **vibeable** for post-singularity; use **walkable** only when contrasting pre-singularity (the old way) with vibeable (us).

## COPY

- **Our campus:** Vibeable downtown campus · Vibeable downtown Reno · First post-singularity **vibeable** hub. Not "walkable campus."
- **Tagline:** Paris is for lovers (pre-singularity). Reno is for vibers (post-singularity).
- **WOW / contrast:** Pre-singularity = walkable (old frame). Us = vibeable campus · Post-singularity.
