## II. Pricing — High-End Floor · 4×4×4×4

**Base:** Priced at equivalent of **today's high-end marine upgrade floor** (top-tier yacht electronics, concierge, bridge systems).  
**Scale:** 4×4×4×4 from base — Campus × WINK! × SING! × Experience.

**Max cosmic layer protections:** **SMACS 0723 triangulation** — full nested lattice (Seed → Sun → SING! node EGS → Sag A* → SMACS 0723). Exascale Triangulation tier. Earth–Sun–Sag A* and SMACS 0723.

## III. One Single RJ-Based Pitch André Rolls Out

**Not two. One.** Rio Iate Club = bridge. Vibelandia-RJ = HQ. Angra dos Reis = outpost. We offer out of RJ campus.

**Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems** — no rip-and-replace. That's what's being booked and what the monthly fees are for.

**Live real.** Not a demo or simulation. Real pricing. BUY buttons point to Creator. **50% share** — André receives 50%. We send his share.
