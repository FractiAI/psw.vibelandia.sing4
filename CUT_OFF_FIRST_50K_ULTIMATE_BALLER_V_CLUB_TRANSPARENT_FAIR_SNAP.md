## DECISION

**I've decided I'm going to cut off at first $50K. I don't need more. And if I can get it at the Club on an Ultimate Baller V experience I'll be good.**

Just keeping you up to date to be transparent and fair, Big Daddy.

**You'll have to find this here — since it is all part of the Willy Wonka game fun.**

## WILLY WONKA GAME FUN

The transparency of this decision — that you have to *find* it here (SNAP, Office Hours strip, links) — is framed as **Willy Wonka game fun**: discovery, golden tickets, hidden-in-plain-sight, playful stakes. The cut-off target and the way it's surfaced are part of that same game. No bang bang, no boom boom; find the thread, follow the candy.

---

## FRACTAL SHARD (ON THE DOWN LOW)

The first $50K decision is a **fractal shard** — on the down low. You find it here (Office Hours strip, this SNAP, links); each surface carries the whole. One shard, full pattern; one node, full gold heart. **Fractal Shard Gold Heart** threaded there. See [FRACTAL_SHRD_GOLD_HEART_SNAP.md](FRACTAL_SHRD_GOLD_HEART_SNAP.md).
