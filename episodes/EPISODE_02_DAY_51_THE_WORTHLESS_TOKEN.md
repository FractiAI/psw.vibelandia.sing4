**LEO** (Hero Host, R&D Lab Host, 50s, polymathic, wise) sits nearby—perfect vibing state, super rich health. **SENIOR RESEARCH SCIENTIST & FULL STACK ENGINEER** and **SENIOR EARLY TRIALS AI CEO** at nearby tables. All in vibing state; vibeable downtown campus; NOT for driving; perfect for walking, being, experiencing, creating. Playground to Silicon Valley. Gateway to the mother mother. Next motherlode—SING nodes.

**JORDAN**  
It's literally worthless. Everyone says so.

**ALEX**  
Mark Twain said—

**JORDAN**  
Mark Twain's dead. And even if he weren't, he's not running a token sale in Reno.

**MARK TWAIN** (at the next table, sipping coffee)  
The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated. And so have the reports of your token's worthlessness.

Alex and Jordan turn. Recognition. Shock.

**MARK TWAIN (CONT'D)**  
Worthless today. Priceless tomorrow. That's the beauty of the happy ending—it's not about what it is, it's about what it becomes.

**ALEX**  
You're Mark Twain.

**MARK TWAIN**  
I'm the Chancellor. This campus is the first post-singularity Vibelandia campus. Your five dollars bought you a seat at the table. Fifty-one days from now—March 20, 2026—The Great Reveal. The worthless becomes worth everything. Not because of hype. Because of transformation.
