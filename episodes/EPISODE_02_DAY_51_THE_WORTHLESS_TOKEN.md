**JORDAN**  
You paid five dollars for Monopoly money? What were you thinking?

**ALEX**  
I don't know. Something just felt right about it.

Worthless today. Priceless tomorrow. That's Episode 02. That's the happy ending.

### ACT 1 — THE DOUBT (10–15 min)

**INT. COFFEE SHOP — CONTINUOUS**

**LEO** (Hero Host, R&D Lab Host, 50s, polymathic, wise) sits nearby—perfect vibing state, super rich health. **SENIOR RESEARCH SCIENTIST & FULL STACK ENGINEER** and **SENIOR EARLY TRIALS AI CEO** at nearby tables. All in vibing state; vibeable downtown campus; NOT for driving; perfect for walking, being, experiencing, creating. Playground to Silicon Valley. Gateway to the mother mother. Next motherlode—SING nodes.

**JORDAN**  
It's literally worthless. Everyone says so.

**ALEX**  
Mark Twain said—

**JORDAN**  
Mark Twain's dead. And even if he weren't, he's not running a token sale in Reno.

**MARK TWAIN** (at the next table, sipping coffee)  
The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated. And so have the reports of your token's worthlessness.

Alex and Jordan turn. Recognition. Shock.

**MARK TWAIN (CONT'D)**  
Worthless today. Priceless tomorrow. That's the beauty of the happy ending—it's not about what it is, it's about what it becomes.

**ALEX**  
You're Mark Twain.

**MARK TWAIN**  
I'm the Chancellor. This campus is the first post-singularity Vibelandia campus. Your five dollars bought you a seat at the table. Fifty-one days from now—March 20, 2026—The Great Reveal. The worthless becomes worth everything. Not because of hype. Because of transformation.

I can see it. The transformation. It's happening now.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Yes. And you're part of it. Your five-dollar token is part of it. The worthless becomes priceless. That's the happy ending.

**JORDAN**
