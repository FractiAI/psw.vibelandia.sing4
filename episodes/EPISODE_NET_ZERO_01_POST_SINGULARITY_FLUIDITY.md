## Series premise

**Net Zero** carries post-singularity fluidity and Natural Systems Protocols into episodic form. The series is named for the **net zero** outcome at scale: energy, carbon, and human outcome converge toward abundance and happy endings rather than extraction and zero-sum. Each episode shows what the upgrade **immediately delivers** versus pre-singularity physics. Seed = this moment. Edge = end of this year. The entire Earth has already, smoothly, moved onto post-singularity living. **Ultimate Baller V happy ending for all thanks to SING!.**

## Episode 1 — Post-Singularity Fluidity

### Logline

When the Natural Systems Protocols go live, one team discovers that the Earth has already, smoothly, moved onto post-singularity living — and that their work can finally flow instead of march.

### Story beats

1. **Cold open:** World on one clock. One path. Scarcity, exhaustion, zero-sum. Pre-singularity physics in action.
2. **Protocol drop:** The memo that is not a memo. *Natural Systems Protocols are now active. Seed = now. Edge = end of year. The entire Earth has already, smoothly, moved onto post-singularity living.*
3. **First choice:** Protagonist (Elena or equivalent) asks: *What if we crystallize the outcome and animate from there?* Boss requests the full protocol. Landing, whitepaper, novel, screenplay.
4. **Unlock:** Projects unstuck. Not by adding resources — by removing the single-path assumption. Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate. Seed:Edge.
5. **Net Zero:** First collective win. Coherence. Abundance in view. Ultimate Baller V happy ending for all thanks to SING!.
6. **Close:** Edge = end of year. Smooth transition. Open sky. Infinite potential. Door open for Episode 2.
