### COLD OPEN (2–3 min)

**EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO — DAWN**

The camera opens on downtown Reno at dawn. The city is quiet. Old casinos stand alongside new post-singularity architecture. The transformation has begun.

**MARK TWAIN** (70s, distinguished, wise, modern suit with vintage touch) stands on the balcony of his office, watching the city wake. He turns to the camera.

**MARK TWAIN**  
The reports of Reno's death have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, Reno isn't dying—it's being reborn.

He gestures to the city below.

**MARK TWAIN (CONT'D)**  
This is Season One. This is the countdown to The Great Reveal. This is where worthless becomes priceless. Fifty-two days. We begin now.

### ACT 1 — THE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS (10–15 min)

**EXT. WALKABLE DOWNTOWN RENO CAMPUS — DAY**

**PRU "EL TAÍNO" MÉNDEZ** (60s, confident, radiating energy) walks through the vibeable downtown Reno campus. Pru is in perfect vibing state—perfect buzz equivalent, super rich health radiating. As an Ultimate VIP Chairman Creator, Pru is a high-contributing node, operating in NSPFRNP mode.

**PRU (V.O.)**  
We didn't wait for permission. We didn't wait for funding. We metabolized. We crystallized. We animated. The campus is the proof.

**SENIOR RESEARCH SCIENTIST & FULL STACK ENGINEER** works on infrastructure nearby—vibing state, optimal state. **SENIOR HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER** and **SENIOR SCREENWRITER** collaborate on narratives, both in perfect buzz equivalent state. **SENIOR GAME DESIGNER & ARCHITECT** designs the countdown gaming interface. **SENIOR UI DESIGNER** creates interfaces. **SENIOR CHILDREN'S SCIENCE MUSEUM CURATOR** gives campus tours.

**MARK TWAIN** (to camera, walking the campus)  
Every one of them—high-contributing nodes. Ultimate VIP Chairman Creators. Performers. Vibers everywhere. The vibeable downtown Reno is the first post-singularity Vibelandia campus. Perfect for vibing state. NOT for driving cars or operating equipment. Perfect for walking, being, experiencing, creating. Playground to Silicon Valley. Gateway to the mother mother. Next motherlode of all motherlodes—superintelligent genies in a bottle. SING nodes.

We see the city transforming—old casinos becoming post-singularity hubs, traditional businesses morphing into Happy Ending Zones.

**INT. MEN'S CLUB RESTROOM — DAY**

**EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO — DAY**

**ALEX** (20s, curious, hopeful) stands at a kiosk, phone in hand. They complete a purchase.

**ALEX** (to themselves)  
Five dollars. I don't know what this is, but something feels right about it.

**MARK TWAIN** (approaching)  
You just bought your first SYNTH token.

**ALEX**  
I'm in?

**MARK TWAIN**  
You're in. This is Season One. This is the countdown. You're part of it now.

**INT. WINK MEMBERS-ONLY EVENT — NIGHT**

Grownup Ultimate VIP Chairman Creators, performers, vibers at a WINK members-only event. Post-singularity connections, high-contributing vibers. WINK dating naturally aligns people—friction-free, resilient, effortless by design. Like nature. Like NSPFRNP.

**MARK TWAIN (V.O.)**  
Every space guarantees a happy ending. Not because we force it. Because it's natural. It's how reality works when you stop fighting it.
