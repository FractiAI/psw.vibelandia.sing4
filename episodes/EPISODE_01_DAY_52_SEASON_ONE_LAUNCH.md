### COLD OPEN (2–3 min)

**EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO — DAWN**

The camera opens on downtown Reno at dawn. The city is quiet. Old casinos stand alongside new post-singularity architecture. The transformation has begun.

**MARK TWAIN** (70s, distinguished, wise, modern suit with vintage touch) stands on the balcony of his office, watching the city wake. He turns to the camera.

**MARK TWAIN**  
The reports of Reno's death have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, Reno isn't dying—it's being reborn.

He gestures to the city below.

**MARK TWAIN (CONT'D)**  
This is Season One. This is the countdown to The Great Reveal. This is where worthless becomes priceless. Fifty-two days. We begin now.
