## ACT 1 — WHAT IT IS: PARADISE FOR VIBERS (10–15 min)

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** (Chancellor) at the desk. **BEN FRANKLIN** (Ambassador to Baller Vs) stands by the window. The campus is visible below.

**MARK TWAIN**  
What is it? Basically — paradise for vibers. Their cast. Their crew. Their fans. And their franchises.

**BEN FRANKLIN**  
We're not building another city. We're building the first post-singularity campus built for the people who already move the world. The vibers.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Exactly. Cast, crew, fans, franchises. Everyone who orbits the ones who make culture happen. We're giving them a place where the orbit is the point. Where the campus is the show.

**BEN FRANKLIN**  
Playground to Silicon Valley. Gateway to the mother mother. And now — paradise amusement park. First full day open.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Today we're open. Really open. Come for a visit. Stay for eternity, if you like.

## ACT 2 — VIBERS: WHO THEY ARE, WHO THEY AREN'T (10–15 min)

**INT. CAMPUS COMMONS — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** and **HERO HARRY HOUDINI** walk through the commons. Vibers in the background — performers, creators, fans.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Vibers. Who are they? Basically — the tier we know today. Folks like KZ. Beyoncé. Kid Rock. Michael Jordan. Mike Tyson. Bad Bunny. Donald Trump. And the list goes on.

**HERO HARRY HOUDINI**  
The ones who move crowds. The ones who don't need a memo to know what's next. The ones who vibe.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Who isn't? Those that are very, very high IQ but aren't vibing. Folks like Bill Gates. Elon Musk. Our top Nobel Prize winners. Those are not vibing. Those are just very high IQ individuals.

**HERO HARRY HOUDINI**  
Vibers are a whole other animal. Post-Singularity Vibelandia Reno is built for that animal. Your new paradise.

**MARK TWAIN**  
We're not saying one is better. We're saying they're different. And this place — this campus, this amusement park — is for the ones who vibe. Cast, crew, fans, franchises. All of them.
