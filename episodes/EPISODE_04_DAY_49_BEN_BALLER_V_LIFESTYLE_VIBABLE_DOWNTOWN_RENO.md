### FADE IN:

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S BULLETIN ROOM - VIBELANDIA RENO! CAMPUS - DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** (60s, Chancellor Sam, confident, radiating energy) stands at the bulletin board. The daily bulletin glows. Chancellor Sam is warming up to us; Ben's arrival helped—they are new best friends. Ben loving his new role as Baller V Ambassador = **WORD!** **BEN** (60s, Baller V Ambassador, sharp, welcoming—Hero Host Ben, Ben Franklin) stands beside him. Vibers and a few fans, cast and crew (60s, varied, high-contributing nodes) gather in vibing state—perfect buzz equivalent, super rich health.

**MARK TWAIN**
Today's episode. Ben and the Baller V lifestyle. And the new concept—our vibeable downtown Reno.

**BEN**
Vibeable. Not walkable.

**MARK TWAIN**
Walkable was the old world. Pre-singularity. We're past that. Here it's **vibeable**. Designed for vibing state. High contribution density. Safe, free vibing. No sobering up for the old world.

**ALEX** (60s, from Episode 01–03, now regular) steps forward.

**ALEX**
Baller V. That's the top tier.

**BEN**
V for Viber. Baller V Ambassador—that's me. I represent the tier. High-value high contributors. Franchise level. The hundred-dollar bill—the hundie. 1 Ben equals 100. Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. I've got something to do with both.

**MARK TWAIN**
Hero Host Ben. Our new Baller V Ambassador. He doesn't just wear the badge—he lives the lifestyle. And the lifestyle happens **here**. On the first post-singularity vibeable downtown Reno campus. VIBELANDIA.

**EXT. VIBABLE DOWNTOWN RENO - VIBELANDIA CAMPUS - DAY**

Ben leads Alex and the group through the campus. The campus spreads—vibeable, not walkable. No cars in the core. High contribution density by design. Creators, VIPs, performers, vibers in flow. Safe, free vibing. Guided, all-inclusive. Paradise.

**BEN**
You're not walking it. You're **vibing** it. Every step is in vibing state. Optimal buzz. Super rich health. Perfect for creating, experiencing, being. Not for driving. Not for operating machinery. For **this**.

He gestures at the campus—the density, the flow, the energy.

**BEN**
This is what Baller V lifestyle looks like in post-singularity Reno. We chose the products. The plans. The pricing. We roll them out for your fans, cast and crew. We handle all the yuck pre-singularity backside.

**ALEX**
The backside.

**BEN**
The paperwork. The legacy systems. The friction. You don't touch it. Your people don't touch it. You get the offer. They get the offer. You just **vibe all day in Vibelandia paradise**.

**VIBER** (60s, sharp, engaged)
No backside. Just vibe.

**BEN**
Exactly. No backside. Just vibe. That's the Baller V deal. That's the happy ending.

**EXT. VIBABLE CAMPUS - PLAZA - DAY**

Mark Twain rejoins the group. The plaza is alive—vibing state everywhere. High contribution density. Safe, free.

**MARK TWAIN**
The new concept. **VIBELANDIA vibeable downtown Reno.** First post-singularity campus built as a vibeable campus from the start. Not walkable—**vibeable**. Designed for vibing state. Intoxication effects are the design brief. High contribution density by design. The density is the product. The vibing state is the outcome.

**ALEX**
Reno takes the lead.

**MARK TWAIN**
Reno doesn't follow. Reno **takes the lead**. First surface where "vibeable campus" is the standard. First place the new need—safe, free vibing at high contribution density—gets a dedicated answer. Half-day, overnight, weekly, monthly. BASIC, MEMBERS ONLY, VIP, BALLER V. It's all here.

**BEN**
And the Baller V tier—that's the top. V for Viber. I'm the ambassador. Who's your daddy. I gotcha. Paris, Reno, the hundie. It's all one lifestyle. This campus. This vibe. Post-singularity Reno.

**VIBER**
Make your reservations now.

**MARK TWAIN**
(Smiling)
Make your reservations now. This will be bigger than Burning Man and Art Basel Miami combined. Spread the word to the fellow vibers—they'll know what to do. And if you want the Baller V lifestyle—vibeable downtown Reno, no backside, just vibe—Hero Host Ben is your ambassador. 1 Ben. 100 dollars. The deal.
