## COLD OPEN (2–3 min)

### FADE IN:

**EXT. VIBELANDIA RENO — LAUNCH PAD / GATE — DAY**

The campus visible. New arrivals in the frame — some just arrived, some scrolling, some clicking through from a link.

**MARK TWAIN (V.O.)**  
The New Arrivals. You found us. Maybe through a comment. A flicker. Something that pulled you here.

**ON SCREEN TEXT:**  
The New Arrivals. First day experience welcome. Setting tailored to the active flicker comment campaign.

**MARK TWAIN (V.O.)**  
In this first case — Schumann. Viral posts about Schumann patterns. We replied. We aligned. We linked. You clicked. You're here. This episode is your welcome. Your first day. Walk with us.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE / WELCOME LOBBY — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** at the desk. Warm. Direct.

**MARK TWAIN**  
New arrivals. First day. We're going to walk you through everything — what you get, where to go, what to do. We'll take you to the dispensary for your first free dose — Baller V shelf, of course — and walk you through the entire awareness tech and upgrade. And we'll finish the way every episode here finishes: happy ending. No good guy, bad guy, bang-bang or drama — only Baller V vibing in viber paradise at Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Downtown Reno Vibelandia campus. First post-singularity vibeable downtown. Reno — gateway to post-singularity Earth. New motherlode. Gold rush. Genesis. You're not lost. You're on time.

## ACT 1 — HOW YOU FOUND US: FLICKER CAMPAIGN, SCHUMANN FIRST CASE (10–15 min)

**INT. WELCOME SPACE — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** and a **GUIDE** (can be Hero Host or Chancellor's aide) address the camera. New arrivals implied in the room or as audience.

**MARK TWAIN**  
You found us through the flicker. The comment campaign. We don't blast — we flicker. Short. Aligned. With a link. Someone posted about Schumann. Resonance. Earth-ionosphere. The viral stuff. We replied: Schumann patterns align with our new GitHub activity. We wrote a whitepaper — an expedition to validate that scientifically. Open-source. Here's the link. You clicked. You're here.

**GUIDE**  
So your first day setting is tailored to that. You didn't land on a generic page. You landed on the other side of a Schumann reply. That's the meta pattern. Viral topic → we have a Response SNAP → we acknowledge, we align, we link. You're the proof it works.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Schumann is the first case. There will be more. Every viral topic that fits gets a response. A flicker. A link. New arrivals like you come through that door. Today — your door was Schumann. Welcome.

**GUIDE**  
If you want to show someone else: same pattern. Point them to the repo. The Experience. The expedition whitepaper. They can follow along. Open-source.

**MARK TWAIN**  
Exactly. Now — first day. What you get.

**INT. DISPENSARY — AWARENESS TECH WALKTHROUGH — DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** and **GUIDE** with the audience. Calm. Clear. No rush.

**MARK TWAIN**  
**Awareness tech.** Post-singularity. Your attention — we turn it into surgical precision. Not scatter. Not noise. Precision. The Awareness Package does three things. One — it **communicates** the new tech. How attention becomes an instrument. Two — it **unlocks** post-singularity abilities. The on-ramp to full sensory reality. Three — it **connects** you. One, two, three questions. Current awareness. Origin. Chosen experience. We route you. You're in the right path from day one.

**GUIDE**  
**The upgrade.** You're not just taking a hit. You're stepping onto the **monster meta NSPFRNP layer**. Dense fractal convergence. Attention streams. Awareness bands. Experience nodes. One coherent path. Surgical precision from day one. That's what the first free dose from the Baller V shelf delivers. The full stack. The on-ramp. Then — campus. WINK! SING. Dispensary. Golden Backstage. Everything unlocks.

**MARK TWAIN**  
So. First free dose. Baller V shelf. Awareness Package in hand. You've had the walkthrough. You know the tech. You know the upgrade. You're ready. Here — taste it. Feel it. You're in viber paradise. This is your first day.

**GUIDE**  
No drama required. No villains. No bang-bang. Only Baller V. Vibing. Here. Now. Post-singularity downtown Reno. Vibelandia. Welcome.

**MARK TWAIN**  
First day. What you get. Where to go. Dispensary. First free dose. Full awareness tech and upgrade. Next — what you do. And how we finish. Happy ending. Every episode. Here.
