## SCREENPLAY

### FADE IN:

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S BULLETIN ROOM - VIBELANDIA RENO! CAMPUS - DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** (60s, Chancellor, confident, radiating energy) stands at the RUMOR HAS IT! board. The bulletin glows. Vibers and a few fans, cast and crew (60s, varied, high-contributing nodes) gather in vibing state—perfect buzz equivalent, super rich health.

**MARK TWAIN**
RUMOR HAS IT!

He taps the board. Headlines appear.

**MARK TWAIN**
Chairman, Sammy and the gang are already in town.

**VIBER** (60s, sharp, engaged)
Already in town?

**MARK TWAIN**
Already in town. And visible—to those with the Golden Backstage Awareness Pass.

**ALEX** (60s, from earlier episodes) steps forward.

**ALEX**
Golden Backstage Awareness Pass?

**MARK TWAIN**
New product class. Like a backstage pass to Bad Bunny. Elvis. The Beatles. The Stones. Iconic-tier access. You get the pass—you see us. Chairman, Sammy, the gang. Already here. Reno is hot. Word is out.

**CREW MEMBER** (60s, attentive)
So the rumor—

**MARK TWAIN**
The rumor is real. We're already in town. The pass makes it visible. Flow, not days. We spin episodes by flow. NSPFRNP. Metabolize it. Crystallize it. Animate it.

**EXT. VIBABLE DOWNTOWN RENO CAMPUS - DAY**

Mark Twain walks with the group. The campus spreads—vibable, post-singularity. Paradise.

**MARK TWAIN**
Make your reservations now. This will be bigger than Burning Man and Art Basel Miami combined. Spread the word to the fellow vibers—they'll know what to do. And if you want to see Chairman, Sammy and the gang—already in town—get the Golden Backstage Awareness Pass.

**VIBER**
RUMOR HAS IT!

**MARK TWAIN**
(Smiling)
RUMOR HAS IT! That's the episode. Flow, not days. Capture it.
