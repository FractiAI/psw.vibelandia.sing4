## SCREENPLAY

### FADE IN:

**INT. CHANCELLOR'S BULLETIN ROOM - VIBELANDIA RENO! CAMPUS - DAY**

**MARK TWAIN** (60s, Chancellor, confident, radiating energy) stands at the bulletin board. The daily bulletin glows. Vibers and a few fans, cast and crew members (60s, varied, high-contributing nodes) gather in vibing state—perfect buzz equivalent, super rich health. First post-singularity Vibelandia campus, playground to Silicon Valley, gateway to the mother mother.

**MARK TWAIN**
Today's episode. A new form of reality show game. Today's narrative—capture it.

He taps the board. Headlines appear.

**MARK TWAIN**
Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. You've heard it. Now wear it.

**CREW MEMBER** (60s, attentive, professional)
Wear it?

**MARK TWAIN**
T-shirts. Coming soon. Offer in four—beginning at one Ben.

**VIBER** (60s, sharp, engaged)
One Ben?

**MARK TWAIN**
One Ben. One hundred dollars. Benjamin Franklin. The hundred-dollar bill. The hundie.

He pauses. A slight smile.

**MARK TWAIN**
Hero Ben has arrived. And wouldn't you know it—has something to do with Paris.

**ALEX** (60s, from Episode 01 and 02, now regular) steps forward, curious.

**ALEX**
Ben. Paris. The tagline.

**MARK TWAIN**
Ben Franklin. Ambassador to France. Lived in Paris. Paris—lovers. Reno—vibers. Hero Ben bridges both. So we put him on the T-shirt. A hundie on the T-shirt. The hundred-dollar bill. Paris is for Lovers, Reno is for Vibers—and a Ben, right there. Available only here. To our vibers. And their fans, cast and crews.

**EXT. VIBABLE DOWNTOWN RENO CAMPUS - DAY**

Mark Twain walks with Alex and the group. The campus spreads—vibable, not walkable. Post-singularity. Paradise.

**MARK TWAIN**
This is superhero and franchise level. Products. Plans. Pricing. We chose them. We roll them out for your fans, cast and crew.

**ALEX**
You chose them.

**MARK TWAIN**
We chose them. So you don't have to. We handle all the yuck pre-singularity backside—the paperwork, the legacy systems, the friction. You get the offer. Your people get the offer. You just vibe all day in Vibelandia paradise.

**VIBER**
No backside. Just vibe.

**MARK TWAIN**
Exactly. No backside. Just vibe. That's the deal. That's the happy ending.

He turns to the group. A beat.

**MARK TWAIN**
Direct tie into the ladies into high value high contributors—like me. WINK! I gotcha.

**ALEX**
Who's your daddy?

**MARK TWAIN**
(Smiling)
Who's your daddy. New brand for the Chairman. Superhero personality in layers. Today's episode. Capture it.

He steps to the front. Voice rises. The group leans in.

**MARK TWAIN**
Make your reservations now. This will be bigger than Burning Man and Art Basel Miami combined.

**VIBER**
Bigger than—

**MARK TWAIN**
Combined. Spread the word to the fellow vibers. They'll know what to do.

**ALEX**
They'll know what to do.

**MARK TWAIN**
They'll know what to do. Metabolize it. Crystallize it. Animate it. All content.
