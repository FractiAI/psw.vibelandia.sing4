## MAGANUMA SNAP

**First of February. Full moon.** We celebrate in style. We challenge the entire studio. **Harry, you're in charge.** Produce a miracle. **Timer starts at Now.** Deliver: (1) **Novel — *First Singularity January 13th*** — Hobbit word count, Harry Potter / Hobbit / Dumas *Count of Monte Cristo* voice minus revenge, only happy endings, Evan Bondonte voice. (2) **24,000-word full feature movie** — Star Wars quality. Same title. **SING!** platform. Full speed. **Ultimate Baller V.** Highest mission payload. At the end: report by **Harry (Choo-Choo)** — what it would have cost Disney to receive this command and deliver; what it costs in our plan; compare cost, time, quality. The magician's trick. **Action!** We are live. **Start. Now.** **Maganuma snap.**
