- **Arrival:** Oooos and ahhhhhs on arrival.
- **Beat:** A sudden hush of the full party.
- **Dos Equis “Most Interesting Man” moment:** He proclaims: **“Let the party now shift to Ultimate Baller V mode for all who wish it — and take care of the wishes of the other guests as they wish. Let the celebration begin!”**
- **No revenge.** Only happy endings. Vibelandia. The return is triumph, not vengeance.
