## How to expand

1. Open [EPISODES_RICH_60_MINUTE_FULLY_SCRIPTED_DIRECTIVE.md](EPISODES_RICH_60_MINUTE_FULLY_SCRIPTED_DIRECTIVE.md) for structure and word targets per act.
2. For each episode: add full scenes, dialogue, and action beats in Cold Open, Act 1, Act 2, Act 3, and Tag until the file is **12,000 words**.
3. Use [episodes/EPISODE_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_NIGHT_AT_THE_CLUB.md](episodes/EPISODE_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_NIGHT_AT_THE_CLUB.md) as the **12k template** (full dialogue, CUT TOs, guest/host/V.O. pattern).
4. Run word count: `node scripts/expand-episode-to-12k.mjs` (or editor/word count on each file). Update this table when an episode hits 12k.
