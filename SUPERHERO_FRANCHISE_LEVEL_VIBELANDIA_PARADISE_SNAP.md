## RULE

**Superhero and franchise level** — products, plans, and pricing **we chose**; **we roll them out** for your fans, cast and crew. We handle **all the yuck pre-singularity backside**. You just **vibe all day in Vibelandia paradise**.

- **Superhero and franchise level:** Our products, plans, and pricing are at that tier — not commodity, not generic. Equivalent to top guided expeditions, top-tier dating, SING! nodes, Chairman Console, Happy Ending Zones.
- **We chose them:** Curated, crystallized — not random. NSPFRNP fidelity.
- **We roll them out for your fans, cast and crew:** You get the offer; we deliver it to your people (fans, cast, crews). Same audience as RENO_FOR_VIBERS and Paris is for Lovers / Reno is for Vibers merch — vibers and their ecosystem.
- **All the yuck pre-singularity backside:** Operations, paperwork, legacy systems, friction — we handle it. You don’t.
- **You just vibe all day in Vibelandia paradise:** Outcome. No backside. Pure experience. Vibelandia = paradise; you vibe.
