## NARRATIVE

**Book Pru** is the SNAP for speaking arrangements: conferences, sales meetings, fun things only — no academic bullshit. Invite Pru to present; invite crew to train your sales force, marketing force, executive force with the new vibing. One-page landing, buttons (Invite Pru to present · Invite crew to train · Book Pru), email to schedule and consultation; we handle everything offline. Old school. We are a mix of new and old in this new world. Mark Twain's Vibelandia. Hero Harry Houdini production. Magical production.

**Pricing:** Base price like top-tier sales executive trainer / sales conference keynote. Scale 4×4×4 up to Ultimate Baller V versions of all of these.

**Format:** Self-demo, proving demo. Audience behind presenter; same screen on the big display; guided demo. Opening image: audience in seats, presenter in front — that's my cursor, my attention head; they're downstream of me all in one organism but their nodes are all lit up. Seed node. End node: how easy it is to build themselves into a superhero — plug it into whatever mission they naturally vibe with. Natural System Programming Design. Executive instructions, very specific; we are building libraries and training so that others multiply. Interactive endpoint: decide together on a business venture; produce full novel + two-hour professional screenplay with ending; show Disney production evaluation; send them home with a link to share what we did together live, with its valuation. Just like that!

**Age / access:** 18+ sandbox; 33+ members only; beyond that by invitation only. See AGE_GATES_18_SANDBOX_33_MEMBERS_INVITATION_ONLY_SNAP.md, JUST_LIKE_THAT_BRANDING_SNAP.md.
