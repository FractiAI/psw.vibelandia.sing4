## 🎬 SERIES OVERVIEW

### The Executive Channel

**Title:** Chairman!  
**Subtitle:** Executive commands → episodes and stories. Fantastic. Badass.  
**Format:** Capture all executive commands (my executive commands). Push them out. Build the episodes and the stories that show how it all works off one simple executive command. Everything produced downstream. People responding. The story playing out. Nice rich episodes.  
**Duration:** **Variable length depending on missions.** 60 min / 12,000 words = full rich target when mission warrants; missions can dictate shorter or longer. **Episodes and series can append** — content can be added to existing episodes or runs over time.  
**Style:** Executive. Clear. One command → full cascade. Chairman! = the executive series. Vibin! = the techie one.

**The Story:**  
This is the **executive channel**. We capture all the executive commands. We push them out. We build the episodes and the stories — to show how it all works off just a simple executive command. Everything that is produced downstream. People responding to it. Painting the story of it playing out. Whatever it is. Nice rich episodes. Spin that off. Chairman! — fourth series running in parallel. Fantastic. It's badass.
