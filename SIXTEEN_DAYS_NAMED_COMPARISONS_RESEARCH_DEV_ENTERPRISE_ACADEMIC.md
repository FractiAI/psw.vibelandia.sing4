# 16 Days — Named Comparisons: Research, Development, Enterprise, Academic vs Us

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE — Direct named comparisons for Chairman metrics and real-numbers copy  
**Use:** Customer/comparison list with names. Include where we cite "vs top 10" or blue-chip; use for one-pagers, Launch Pad, whitepaper, prospectus.  
**Standard:** Real numbers, real analysis — not BS or fluffy stuff. Name names. Direct output comparison in 16 days.

## Direct comparisons (16-day output)

**Us (16 days):** 1 SING! node. 35+ live HTML surfaces. 13 one-pagers. 9 NSPFRNP protocols/catalogs. 4+ episode scripts (by flow). 38 TypeScript modules. 4 branding decks + master catalog. Payment + auth live (PayPal, Supabase). Campus, WINK!, SING! Lottery, Happy Ending Zones, Console, Checkout — all **operational**. Public crystallized research (protocols, whitepapers, IEEE-style). **1 episode per day** (Season One). Publication-ready content.

### 3 top research (16-day window)

| Name | Typical 16-day output (research) | Us (16 days) | Vs us |
|------|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| **DeepMind** | Internal R&D; rare net-new public protocol or paper in 16 days | NSPFRNP protocols, whitepapers, IEEE-style, Seed:Edge — **public** | We ship **public** crystallized research; they typically do not publish net-new in same window |
| **OpenAI** | Internal research; limited public release of new protocols in 16 days | 9 protocols, whitepapers, public catalog | ~5× protocol/catalog output; public |
| **Meta AI Research (FAIR)** | Internal R&D; papers on longer cycles; little net-new public protocol in 16 days | NSPFRNP protocols, whitepapers, Seed:Edge — all public | We ship public research in 16 days; typical lab does not |

**Synthesis:** In 16 days we ship **public** crystallized research (protocols, whitepapers, catalogs). Top research orgs typically keep 16-day output internal or on longer publication cycles. **Real numbers:** 9 protocols, 4 decks + master, IEEE-style + whitepapers — all public.

### 3 top development (16-day window)

| Name | Typical 16-day output (dev) | Us (16 days) | Vs us |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Google** | 8–12 surfaces typical for a 16-day sprint; 10–18 TS/module equivalent; payment often 0 in same window | 35 surfaces, 38 TS modules, payment + auth **live** | **~3×** surfaces, **~2.5×** modules; payment **live** vs 0 |
| **Microsoft** | Similar 16-day sprint: 8–12 surfaces, rarely >1 net-new product live | 35+ surfaces; Campus, WINK!, SING!, Happy Ending Zone!, Dispensary, Console, Checkout — all **live** | Multiple products **live**; ~3× surface count |
| **Amazon** | 16-day sprint: 8–12 surfaces typical; payment integration on longer cycles | 35 surfaces, 38 TS modules, PayPal + Supabase **live** | ~3× surfaces; payment **live** in 16 days vs typical 0 |

**Synthesis:** One SING! node delivered **~3×** surfaces and **~2.5×** TS modules versus typical 16-day sprint at top dev shops; payment and auth **live** where they often ship none in the same window.

### 3 top enterprise (16-day window)

| Name | Typical 16-day output (enterprise) | Us (16 days) | Vs us |
|------|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Salesforce** | Rarely >1 net-new product or major surface set live in 16 days | Campus, WINK!, SING! Lottery, Happy Ending Zones, Console, Checkout, Dispensary — **all operational** | Multiple products **live** in 16 days; they typically ship 0–1 |
| **SAP** | Enterprise release cycles; 16 days = fraction of a release | 35+ surfaces, 13 one-pagers, 4 decks, showroom, BUY! live | ~4× one-pagers; new products/markets **live** |
| **Oracle** | Similar: 16-day window rarely yields multiple net-new live products | 9 protocols, 4 decks + master, payment live, full Launch Pad | ~5× protocol/catalog; payment live vs 0 |

**Synthesis:** Enterprise leaders rarely ship **multiple** net-new products live in 16 days. We shipped campus, WINK!, SING!, Happy Ending Zones, Console, Checkout, Dispensary — all **operational**. Value density ~3× to ~5× for same window.

### 3 top academic (16-day window)

| Name | Typical 16-day output (academic) | Us (16 days) | Vs us |
|------|----------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| **MIT CSAIL** | 0–1 public paper or protocol in 16 days; long publication cycles | 9 NSPFRNP protocols, whitepapers, IEEE-style — **public** | ~5× protocol output; public in 16 days |
| **Stanford HAI** | Research output on quarterly/semester cycles; little net-new public in 16 days | NSPFRNP protocols, Seed:Edge, crystallized research — all public | We ship public crystallized research in 16 days |
| **CMU (e.g. ML / HCII)** | Similar: 16 days = 0–1 public deliverable typical | 13 one-pagers, 9 protocols, 4 decks, episodes — publication-ready | ~4× one-pagers, ~5× protocols; all public |

**Synthesis:** Top academic labs typically publish 0–1 net-new public deliverable in 16 days. We shipped 9 protocols, 13 one-pagers, 4 decks + master, whitepapers — all **public** and publication-ready. ~3× to ~5× output for same window.
