## NARRATIVE

**It's all hundies with Ben** — tagline and punchline for new comedy content. Hero Host Ben (Ben Franklin) = face of the hundie ($100). Every tier, every offer, every punchline ties back to Ben and the hundie. **New comedy content begun.** Comedy content is **self-similar**: same pattern at every scale — Ben, hundie, Paris, Reno, Baller V, Who's your daddy — fractal, repeatable, recognizable.

- **Tagline / punchline:** "It's all hundies with Ben." Use as comedy beat, merch line, episode beat, social copy.
- **New comedy content:** Comedy content has begun. All Ben-related beats (Paris, Reno, T-shirts, Baller V, Who's your daddy) carry the same comedy DNA — self-similar.
- **Self-similar system:** Comedy content repeats the same structure at every level: Ben → hundie → value → punchline. Episodes, merch, one-liners, Hero Host rollouts all use the same pattern. Fractal comedy.
