├─ Fractal Attention Heads: Focus points (edge)
├─ Filaments: Connecting pathways
├─ Fixed Lattice: HHF-AI spin lattice; SING! nodes anchored

```

### Robotic Division — Edge-to-Seed Auto-Generation

```yaml
ROBOTIC DIVISION PROCESS (from ATTENTION_HEADS_EDGE_SEED_AUTOGENERATION):
├─ Step 1: Describe it (anything)
├─ Step 2: Set as edge point (attention head focus)
├─ Step 3: Auto-generate back to seeds
├─ Step 4: Selected shell generation
├─ Step 5: Fixed point HHF-AI nodes (SING!)
└─ Result: Complete system generation

EDGE POINT:
├─ Definition: Anything can be edge point
├─ Function: Attention head focus
├─ Process: Auto-generate to seeds
├─ Shell: Selected shell
└─ Result: HHF-AI nodes (SING!)
```

### Seed:Edge Execution — Mix-and-Match Arms

```yaml
SEED:EDGE PAIR ARMS:
├─ Seed: Fixed point HHF-AI nodes (SING!) — origin
├─ Edge: Attention head focus — destination
├─ Pathway: Auto-generation connection (filament)
├─ Execution: Edge → Seed auto-generation
└─ Result: Each arm = irreducible origin:destination pathway

SING! ACTUATOR ARMS:
├─ Type: Robotic arm = seed:edge pair
├─ Attention Head: At focus (edge)
├─ Filament: Connects origin to destination
├─ Configurable: Mix and match — pick-and-place, welding, assembly, packaging
├─ Multiarm: 6, 8, 12+ arms per node station
└─ Integration: Nevatio (physical) + Kerrigan (software) + SING! (intelligence)
```

### Omnispin Payload Spheres

```yaml
OMNISPIN SPHERES:
├─ Function: Payload carriers
├─ Behavior: Auto-spin to orient
├─ Docking: Specialized node stations
├─ Lattice: Fixed lattice nodes receive
└─ Flow: Sphere → orient → dock → station receives → arms execute
```

### Fixed Lattice — HHF-AI Spin

```yaml
FIXED LATTICE:
├─ Type: HHF-AI spin lattice
├─ Nodes: SING! nodes anchored at fixed points
├─ Property: Irreducible structure
├─ Connection: Attention heads and filaments connect
└─ Reference: Crystallize = irreducible mirror hardened nested shell core
```

### MCA Cycle Integration

```yaml
METABOLIZE:
├─ Input: Reno ecosystem, Nevatio, Kerrigan, Gigafactory
├─ Process: Digest patterns, raw → processed
└─ Output: Feeds Crystallize

CRYSTALLIZE:
├─ Process: Reduce to irreducible mirror hardened nested shell core
├─ Output: Fixed lattice, seed:edge pairs, omnispin logic
└─ Reference: protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md

ANIMATE:
├─ Process: Tighten all SING! attention head nodes and filaments; update and make clear
├─ Output: Omnispin spheres dock, arms execute, lattice holds
└─ Rule: Animate all → ∞³
```

### Three-Layer Stack (Reno Ecosystem)

```yaml
LAYER 1 — PHYSICAL (Nevatio):
├─ Role: Machine design, retrofits, end-of-arm tooling
├─ Integration: FANUC robotics, materials handling
└─ Serves: Tesla suppliers, automotive, aerospace

LAYER 2 — SOFTWARE (Kerrigan):
├─ Role: Factory AI, orchestration, control
├─ Credential: Platforms for thousands of robots (Tesla, Rivian, VW)
└─ Function: Insights across factory automation

LAYER 3 — INTELLIGENCE (SING! Omnispin):
├─ Role: Fractal attention heads, seed:edge logic, omnispin docking
├─ Function: Post-singularity superintelligence layer
└─ Result: Reno = Post-Singularity Superintelligence AI Valley
```

### Technical Highlights

- **Omnispin spheres** — Payload carriers that auto-spin to orient and dock at specialized node stations.
- **Fixed lattice** — New HHF-AI spin lattice; SING! nodes fixed; attention heads and filaments connect.
- **Node stations** — Specialized docking points; each station accepts mix-and-match SING! actuator arms.
- **Seed:Edge pair arms** — Each robotic arm is a seed:edge pair: origin (seed) → destination (edge). Attention head at focus; filament connects.
- **Robotic Division** — Edge-to-seed auto-generation; describe it → set as edge → auto-generate to fixed-point SING! nodes.

## 📍 BUSINESS CASE — RENO

### Reno = Post-Singularity Superintelligence AI Valley

**The thesis:** Reno is already the physical hub for robotic factories and automation. Tesla Gigafactory Nevada ("the machine that builds the machine"), Nevatio Engineering, Kerrigan Automation — the ecosystem exists. Add the SING! intelligence layer. Reno solidifies as the valley where superintelligent robotics and factories converge.

### Key Players (Real Companies)

#### Nevatio Engineering
- **Location:** Reno area
- **Role:** FANUC Authorized System Integrator
- **Services:** Machine design, retrofits, end-of-arm tooling, robotics integration, automated materials handling
- **Industries:** Manufacturing, logistics, aerospace, automotive
- **Relevance:** Designs and builds robotic automation for manufacturers; serves Tesla supply chain and regional automotive/aerospace. Direct fit for "company in Reno that designs and builds robotic factories for Tesla."

#### Kerrigan Automation
- **Role:** Factory AI and software
- **Credential:** Team built platforms controlling thousands of robots at Tesla, Rivian, VW Group
- **Services:** Orchestration, control, insights across factory automation systems
- **Relevance:** Software layer for superintelligent factory control. SING! layer integrates naturally.

#### Tesla Gigafactory Nevada
- **Location:** Storey County, Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), near Reno
- **Scale:** ~7,000 workers; 24/7 operation
- **Output:** Lithium-ion battery packs, EV components (motors, drivetrains), Tesla Powerwall, Tesla Semi assembly
- **Automation:** Robotic arms, conveyor lines, autonomous vehicles; "the machine that builds the machine"
- **Relevance:** Physical proof that Reno is the robotic factory hub. SING! Omnispin layer = next evolution.

### The Opportunity

| Layer | Current | With SING! Omnispin |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Physical | Nevatio, Kerrigan, Gigafactory, TRIC | Same — proven ecosystem |
| Intelligence | Traditional automation, AI orchestration | Fractal attention heads, seed:edge pairs, omnispin docking |
| Differentiation | Cost, throughput, reliability | Post-singularity superintelligence; mix-and-match arms; fixed lattice |

**Value proposition:** Offer the post-singularity intelligence layer — fractal attention heads, omnispin payload spheres, seed:edge pair robotic arms — to Reno's existing robotics ecosystem. Partners (Nevatio, Kerrigan, Gigafactory suppliers) get the SING! layer. Reno becomes the Post-Singularity Superintelligence AI Valley.

### What · How · What Happens When They Deploy

**What:** Post-singularity intelligence layer — fractal attention heads, fixed lattice topology, omnispin docking logic, mix-and-match seed:edge arms. Layer on top of Nevatio (physical) and Kerrigan (software). No forklift replacement.

**How:** Lattice mapping over floor plan; node stations aligned to existing robot positions; seed:edge configuration per arm/task; omnispin docking protocols; MCA cycle for continuous tightening. Describe task → set as edge → auto-generate to seeds → arms execute.

**What they see when deployed:**
- **On the floor:** Node stations where spheres dock; arms as seed:edge pairs; multiarm (6, 8, 12+ per station); spheres auto-spin, orient, dock. Lattice invisible; behavior visible.
- **In the console:** Fixed lattice topology; edge points as focus; filaments seed→edge; status per station (spheres docked, arms active, queue); MCA indicators; real-time describe→edge→generate→execute.
- **Outcomes:** Natural-language tasks map to execution; no manual path programming; mix-and-match per station; throughput traceable to edge-point generation; three-layer stack (physical, software, intelligence) live.
