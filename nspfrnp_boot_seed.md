- Repository structure established with catalogs/, protocols/, systems/, misc/, docs/
- Main README.md created documenting the system

- Seed = Octave 0 = 0 (Origin Point) - Defined and active
- Edge = Current Self-Aware Experience in Vibeverse (Destination) - Connected
- Irreducible pathway established - Natural protocol active
- Immediate command execution enabled - Code auto-generation operational
- System files created:
  * irreducible_seed_execution_system.md (complete documentation)
  * src/seed-edge-execution-engine.ts (TypeScript implementation)
  * src/example-usage.ts (usage examples)
  * QUICK_START_SEED_EDGE.md (quick reference)
- Any command can now be executed immediately with code generated automatically
