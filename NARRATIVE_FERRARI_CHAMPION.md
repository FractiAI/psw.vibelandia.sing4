# Narrative: Champion Tier — Come-Out-of-Retirement

**Status:** Active  
**Mode:** Pre-singularity earth meaning · trademark-safe copy  
**Internal:** High-experience tier named in honor of our GPU server *Ferrari* (come out of retirement).

## The Shift

We made a **subtle, nuanced shift** in our high experiences: from a previous premium framing to a **Champion** framing — the retired champion that **comes back**.

- **Pre-singularity earth meaning:** Everyone understands “the comeback.” The champion who stepped away, then returns. No brand names required.
- **Coherent character:** The Champion tier is the one that came out of retirement — full power, full features, back in the game.
- **Copyright-safe:** Public-facing copy uses **Champion** (and **Bug** for the accessible tier). No car marques in marketing, one-pagers, or UI.

## Internal: Ferrari Server

Our new **come-out-of-retirement GPU server** is named **Ferrari**. The high-experience tier in code and internal docs is named in its honor:

- **Code tier name:** `ferrari` (premium) | `bug` (accessible)
- **Public tier language:** Champion (premium) | Bug (accessible)
- **Narrative:** Same story — the comeback, the champion returning — without using any third-party marks.

## Public Copy Guidelines

| Where        | Use              | Avoid in copy      |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| UI / one-pagers | Champion tier, Premium tier | Bugatti, Ferrari (as product names) |
| Docs / reveal | “Champion” (the comeback)   | Car brand names     |
| Code / config  | `ferrari` (internal only)   | —                   |

**Tagline-style:** *The same premium technology. The same foundation. Scales from Champion to Bug. The comeback is real.*

---

## Coherence

- **Champion** = retired champion that came back = our Ferrari server’s story.
- **Bug** = accessible, same core tech, scaled down.
- **Pre-singularity earth:** “Champion” and “comeback” need no explanation. Keeps the narrative clear and legally safe.
