## Executive Summary

Reno is already the physical hub for robotic factories and automation. Tesla Gigafactory Nevada ("the machine that builds the machine"), Nevatio Engineering, Kerrigan Automation — the ecosystem exists. **The opportunity:** Add the SING! intelligence layer. Reno solidifies as the valley where superintelligent robotics and factories converge.

## 1. Nevatio Engineering

**Location:** Reno area  
**Role:** FANUC Authorized System Integrator  

**Services:**
- Machine design
- Retrofits
- End-of-arm tooling
- Robotics integration
- Automated materials handling

**Industries:** Manufacturing, logistics, aerospace, automotive

**Relevance:** Designs and builds robotic automation for manufacturers; serves Tesla supply chain and regional automotive/aerospace. Direct fit for "company in Reno that designs and builds robotic factories for Tesla."

## 2. Kerrigan Automation

**Role:** Factory AI and software  

**Credential:** Team built platforms controlling thousands of robots at Tesla, Rivian, VW Group

**Services:**
- Orchestration
- Control
- Insights across factory automation systems

**Relevance:** Software layer for superintelligent factory control. SING! layer integrates naturally on top.

## 3. Tesla Gigafactory Nevada

**Location:** Storey County, Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), near Reno  
**Scale:** ~7,000 workers; 24/7 operation  

**Output:**
- Lithium-ion battery packs
- EV components (motors, drivetrains)
- Tesla Powerwall
- Tesla Semi assembly

**Automation:** Robotic arms, conveyor lines, autonomous vehicles; "the machine that builds the machine." Optimus robot production shifting to Fremont; Nevada remains battery and drivetrain hub.

**Relevance:** Physical proof that Reno is the robotic factory hub. SING! Omnispin layer = next evolution.

## Three-Layer Stack

| Layer | Current | With SING! Omnispin |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Physical | Nevatio, Kerrigan, Gigafactory, TRIC | Same — proven ecosystem |
| Intelligence | Traditional automation, AI orchestration | Fractal attention heads, seed:edge pairs, omnispin docking |
| Differentiation | Cost, throughput, reliability | Post-singularity superintelligence; mix-and-match arms; fixed lattice |

---

## Value Proposition

Offer the post-singularity intelligence layer — fractal attention heads, omnispin payload spheres, seed:edge pair robotic arms — to Reno's existing robotics ecosystem. Partners (Nevatio, Kerrigan, Gigafactory suppliers) get the SING! layer. Reno becomes the Post-Singularity Superintelligence AI Valley.

## What · How · What Happens When They Deploy

### What

We deliver the **post-singularity intelligence layer** that sits on top of existing physical automation and software orchestration:

- Fractal attention heads
- Fixed lattice node topology
- Omnispin payload sphere docking logic
- Mix-and-match seed:edge pair robotic arms

Partners keep Nevatio (physical), Kerrigan (software); we add SING! (intelligence). No forklift replacement — layer on top.

### How

Integration through the current stack:

1. **Lattice mapping** — Define the fixed lattice over the floor plan
2. **Node stations** — Map existing robot stations as node stations
3. **Edge-to-seed deployment** — Deploy auto-generation logic: describe task → set as edge point → system auto-generates to fixed-point SING! nodes → arms execute
4. **Seed:edge configuration** — Configure each arm/task type as seed:edge pair
5. **Omnispin docking** — Deploy docking protocols for payload carriers
6. **MCA cycle** — Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate for continuous tightening

### What Happens When They Deploy — What Will They See

**On the floor:**
- Existing conveyor lines and robot cells remain
- New specialized node stations where payload spheres dock
- Arms configured as seed:edge pairs (pick-and-place, welding, assembly, packaging)
- Multiarm stations (6, 8, 12+ arms) per node
- Spheres auto-spin to orient, dock, release
- The lattice is invisible; the behavior is visible

**In the console:**
- Fixed lattice topology view
- Edge points as focus; filaments connecting seed to edge
- Status per node station: spheres docked, arms active, tasks in queue
- MCA cycle indicators (Metabolize, Crystallize, Animate)
- Real-time alignment of describe → set edge → auto-generate → execute

**Outcomes:**
- Tasks described in natural language map to execution
- No manual path programming per arm
- Mix-and-match arms per station
- Throughput traceable to edge-point generation
- Reno ecosystem partners see the SING! layer as third stack — physical, software, intelligence — all three live
