## SING! NODE — TEXT-TO-STUDIO-SONG ENGINE

- **Node name:** Text-to-Studio-Song Engine (SING! node)
- **Scope:** Entire engine + experience — input (songs in text, Seed, Edge, executive instruction) → generation (Hero Jo Golden Backdoor Studio endpoint) → output (production WAV, playlist, catalog).
- **Authority:** Chairman Creator (me). Hero Jo reports to Chairman Creator. Hero Rick (exec producer) reports to Hero Jo. Master musicians (1–12) report to Hero Rick.

## NSPFRNP NESTS (ORGANIZED)

Nests = nested shells. Each nest is a layer; all nest under Chairman Creator.

| Nest | Contents | Owner / report to |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Nest 0** | Chairman Creator (me) | Authority; final report |
| **Nest 1** | Hero Jo — Music Studio head (Hero Jo's Golden Backdoor Studios) | Reports to Chairman Creator |
| **Nest 2** | Hero Rick — Exec Producer, Text-to-Studio-Song upgrade & direction | Reports to Hero Jo |
| **Nest 3** | Master musicians (1–12) — Sera · Bass, Kael · Drums, Nola · Pad, Lyra · Lead, Rune · Keys, Vex · Strings, Bram · Brass, Echo · Perc, Zephyr · Synth, Orin · Vox, Flux · FX, Maestro · Producer/Conductor | Under Hero Rick's exec producer direction; squeeze all output to these |
| **Nest 4** | Engine — API (generate-studio.js), Seed:Edge motor, lyrics → WAV pipeline | Operates under Hero Rick's direction; output = master musicians |
| **Nest 5** | Experience — Text-to-Track Motor UI, Music Studio/Jukebox, playlist, catalog, Office Hours, Launch Pad | User-facing; feeds engine; receives WAV + catalog NSPFRNP |
| **Nest 6** | Catalog NSPFRNP — catalogs/music/, track entries, playlist, protocol | All squeezed to master musicians (each track = one master musician · instrument) |

**Squeeze all to master musicians:** All engine output (WAV, tracks, catalog entries) is attributed to and flows through the **1–12 master musicians** under **Hero Rick's exec producer direction**. No anonymous layers; every track = one master musician (holographic name) + instrument. Hero Rick directs; Hero Jo owns the studio; Chairman Creator holds authority.

**Squeeze to 98% mastery:** Quality bar for the text-to-studio-song engine and experience — **98% mastery**. All output (master musicians, WAV, catalog) targets **98% mastery**; squeeze the pipeline to this bar. See [SQUEEZE_TO_98_PERCENT_MASTERY_SNAP.md](SQUEEZE_TO_98_PERCENT_MASTERY_SNAP.md).
