## Directive

- **Episode length is variable depending on missions.** 60 min / 12,000 words = **full rich target** when the mission calls for a full episode; missions can dictate shorter or longer. All series, all seasons.
- **Episodes and series can append.** Content can be added to existing episodes or runs over time; extend in place, no need to replace.
- **When mission warrants full episode:** Full 60-minute episode, fully scripted. 12,000 words. Not outlines — full dialogue and beats.
- **When mission dictates otherwise:** Shorter or longer as mission requires. Same structure (Cold Open, Act 1–3, Tag) scales; quality and NSPFRNP fidelity unchanged.
- **Goal:** Show everyone our **miraculous abilities**, including producing streams of **high-quality content** which will soon be fitted to **text-to-episode SING nodes**.

## Episodes in scope — FULL 60-MINUTE CONTENT REQUIRED (ALL)

**Directive:** **Every episode MUST be 12,000 words. All of them. No exceptions.** Current scripts are ~600–2,300 words — expand every episode to **full 12,000 words** with full dialogue and beats in every act (Cold Open 2–3 min, Act 1–3 each 10–15 min, Tag 2–3 min). No episode is "done" until the file contains **12,000 words** of scripted content. Structure alone is not sufficient — expand every act with full scenes, dialogue, and beats. **All series, all seasons, all episodes = 12,000 words each.**

**Target per act:** ~10–15 min screen time = roughly 5–8 pages of full dialogue and action per act. Expand until every episode reaches full 60-min content.
