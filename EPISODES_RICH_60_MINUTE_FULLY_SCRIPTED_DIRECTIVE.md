## Directive

- **Go back on all episodes.** They need to be **rich 60-minute episodes**, **fully scripted**.
- **Current scripts are ~10 min** (not 60 min). **Redo/expand these** to full 60-min content.
- **Target: 12,000 words per episode for all** — all series, all seasons. Every episode expands to ~12,000 words (full dialogue and beats; ~60 min equivalent).
- **Goal:** Show everyone our **miraculous abilities**, including producing streams of **high-quality content** which will soon be fitted to **text-to-episode SING nodes**.

## Structure (per REALITY_SERIES_FORMAT.md)

1. **Cold Open** (2–3 min): Hook, preview, countdown  
2. **Act 1** (10–15 min): Main story, character development  
3. **Act 2** (10–15 min): Conflict, challenges, development  
4. **Act 3** (10–15 min): Resolution, transformation, happy ending  
5. **Tag** (2–3 min): Countdown update, next episode tease

## Episodes in scope — FULL 60-MINUTE CONTENT REQUIRED (ALL)

**Directive:** Episodes are **not yet** full 60 minutes of content; **current scripts are ~10 min**. **All** episodes must be expanded to **full 60-minute fully scripted** format: full dialogue and beats in every act (Cold Open 2–3 min, Act 1–3 each 10–15 min, Tag 2–3 min). No episode is "done" until it has enough scripted content to fill ~60 minutes. **Target: 12,000 words per episode for all** (all series, all seasons). Structure alone is not sufficient — expand every act with full scenes, dialogue, and beats. **All series, all seasons, all episodes.**

**Target per act:** ~10–15 min screen time = roughly 5–8 pages of full dialogue and action per act. Expand until every episode reaches full 60-min content.
