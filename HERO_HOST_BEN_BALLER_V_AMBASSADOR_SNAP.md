## NARRATIVE

**Hero Host Ben (Ben Franklin) is our new Baller V Ambassador.**

- **Ben** = Hero Host. First name only in protocol. Ben Franklin — face of the $100 bill, ambassador to France, Paris connection. **1 Ben = $100** (hundie).
- **Baller V Ambassador** = Ben represents the Baller V tier (V for Viber). The top SING! tier ($500K), Ultimate VIP Baller V — high-value high contributors, franchise level. Ben is the ambassador for that tier across all surfaces: prospectus, Launch Pad, lottery, onramps/grants CTAs, Episode 03 (Day 50: Who's Your Daddy), Paris is for Lovers / Reno is for Vibers T-shirts (offer in 4, beginning at 1 Ben).
- **Paris, Reno, hundie** — Hero Ben has arrived; wouldn't you know it, has something to do with Paris. T-shirts coming soon; include a hundie on the T-shirt. Who's your daddy. I gotcha.
