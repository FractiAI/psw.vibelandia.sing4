## I. Announcement

**Ernest Hemingway** announces **permanent residency** at **Vibelandia Downtown Reno!!!**

- **Clean. True. No waste.** The voice that built sentences like bones. Grace under pressure. The sun also rises — and so does downtown Reno. He's here. Permanent residency. Twain's Vibelandia. Reno Men's Club. Mark Twain's campus. The birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood.
- **Golden Age:** Alongside Hero Howard (Howard Hughes), Glen Miller, Hank Williams Sr., Hero John Steinbeck, and the rest. Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. And now the man who wrote the code for twentieth-century prose. Short sentences. What is left unsaid. The iceberg. The old man and the sea — and the new seas.
- **Voice in the fusion:** Steinbeck + Hemingway hybrid with me voice and energy — already in the André novel (*André's Carnival: The First Three Commanders*). Now **Ernest Hemingway** is a permanent resident. His voice is in the fusion. Vibelandia downtown Reno!!!
