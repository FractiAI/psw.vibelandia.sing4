## ONE-LINER

**LOCAL ONRAMPS FOR BASE ON ALL PLANS AND PRICING EVERYWHERE.** Base tiers (entry levels) on every NSPFRNP plan and every pricing structure use **local onramps** — localized, local price adjusted — so access is by market, everywhere. Top tiers (e.g. Ultimate Baller V, 4×4×4×4) may use global prices; base is always local onramp.

---

## CANONICAL RULE

- **LOCAL ONRAMPS FOR BASE:** On **all** plans and **all** pricing, the **base** tier (entry level, tier 1, Seed, or equivalent) is a **local onramp** — **localized**, **local price adjusted**. Not one global base price; base is priced for the local market so people can step in where they are.
- **ON ALL PLANS:** Space Cloud Division, FSR Entertainment, Eternal Living Service, Broadcast Pipe Ad Space, SING!, Campus, WINK!, Dispensary, every product family with tiers — base = local onramp.
- **EVERYWHERE:** Every surface, every region, every catalog. New plans and new pricing follow this rule. No exception.

**Do not lose this fidelity.** When adding or updating any plan or pricing, base tier = local onramps.

## TOP TIERS

Top tiers (e.g. **Ultimate Baller V**, **4×4×4×4**, highest plan level) may use **global prices** — one global price anchor. Base is local; top can be global. See [ETERNAL_LIFE_PLANNING_AND_LIVING_SERVICES_SNAP.md](ETERNAL_LIFE_PLANNING_AND_LIVING_SERVICES_SNAP.md) (base = localized, Ultimate Baller V = global).
