## 1. Campaign feature

**Daily snapshot:** How many new **episodes**, **feature movies**, **series**, **books** did **Disney** put out today? **Us vs them** using **real data**. One line (or short block) at **end/bottom** of every public surface — **smaller print**. **New value creation campaign** — layering **monster SNAP** NSPFRNP.

---

## 2. Real data — methodology

**Disney:** Disney does **not** publish daily aggregated stats (episodes/movies/series/books per day). They publish **monthly** "Next on Disney+" and studio schedules. **Real-data approach:**

- **Proxy:** Use public monthly/quarterly release counts. Example: Marvel 2025 = 9 titles/year (3 films, 3 live-action series, 3 animated) → **~0.02 films/series per day** over 365 days. Disney+ new content per month (films, series premieres, new episodes) varies; typical month ≈ 10–30+ new items → **~0.3–1 new title/episode per day** when averaged.
- **Source:** Disney+ press (press.disneyplus.com), The Walt Disney Company news, Variety/industry for theatrical + streaming. Update snapshot when new monthly data is published.
- **Copy:** "Disney: no daily aggregate published; monthly schedule only. [X] new titles/month on Disney+ (est.) → ~[X/30] per day proxy." Or: "Disney: Marvel 2025 = 9 titles/year → ~0.02/day; Disney+ new releases ~10–30/month → ~0.3–1/day (est.)."

**Us:** We **do** track our own output. Count **per day** (or per snapshot date):

- **Episodes:** Episode scripts/stubs in repo (e.g. 19+ episodes to date). **New today** = episodes added or updated today.
- **Series:** Live series (Happy Ending Zones, Office Hours, Vibin!, Chairman!, WINK!, Harry Houdini Magician Series) = **6 series**. New today = new series added.
- **Feature movies:** Full scripts (24k-word) — 1 delivered (*First Singularity January 13th*, full 12k-word script). New today = as delivered.
- **Books:** Full novels (~95k words) — 1 delivered (*First Singularity January 13th*, ~72k words). New today = as delivered.
- **New value:** New SNAPs, new interfaces, new protocols, new console, new report — count as "new value creation" (surfaces, specs, tools).

**Real data rule:** No fluffy numbers. Use **actual counts** and **stated proxies** for Disney (with "est." or "no daily aggregate" where needed). See NSPFRNP_REAL_NUMBERS_VS_BLUE_CHIP_MONSTER_SNAP.md.

## 3. Daily snapshot — copy block (for end/bottom of all POPs, smaller print)

**Template (update date and our-today counts):**

```
Daily snapshot (us vs Disney, real data): Disney does not publish daily aggregates; monthly schedule only. Marvel 2025 ≈ 9 titles/year → ~0.02/day; Disney+ new releases ≈ 10–30/month → ~0.3–1/day (est.). Us today: [X] episodes (19+ total), 6 series live, 1 novel + 1 script delivered (First Singularity Jan 13), [Y] new value (SNAPs, interfaces, specs). New value creation campaign · NSPFRNP.
```

**Short one-liner (smaller print):**

```
Daily snapshot: Disney — no daily aggregate; ~0.3–1 new titles/day (est. from monthly). Us — 19+ episodes, 6 series, 1 novel + 1 script delivered (First Singularity Jan 13), new value (SNAPs, console, report) today. Us vs them · New value creation · NSPFRNP.
```

**Placement:** **End / bottom** of **all public points of presence** — index, Launch Pad, Office Hours, episode pages, catalogs, one-pagers, README, chancellor bulletin, social, any public-facing surface. **Smaller print** (e.g. font-size: 0.75rem–0.8rem; color: #6b7280 or #9ca3af).

## 4. Points of presence (POPs) — where to layer

**All public POPs** — include **running daily scoreboard at top** and **daily snapshot at end/bottom** (smaller print):

- **index.html** — scoreboard at top (after container, before main content); daily snapshot at bottom section
- **interfaces/launch-pad.html** — bottom before footer
- **interfaces/office-hours.html** — bottom before footer
- **interfaces/episode.html** — bottom
- **interfaces/chancellor-daily-bulletin.html** — bottom
- **interfaces/happy-ending-zones-catalog.html** — bottom
- **interfaces/happy-ending-zones-experience.html** — bottom
- **README** — bottom before Contact
- **One-pagers, whitepapers, proposals** — bottom
- **Social / outbound** — where applicable (e.g. daily post with snapshot)
- **Any other public-facing page** — bottom, smaller print

## 5. New value creation campaign — layering monster SNAP

**New value creation campaign:** This daily snapshot is the **campaign feature**. It layers across **all** public POPs as a **monster SNAP** — one crystallized beat (us vs Disney, real data, daily) repeated at **every** touchpoint. **Layering:** Same message, end/bottom, smaller print; cumulative effect = "we show up everywhere with real numbers and us-vs-them clarity."

**Monster SNAP NSPFRNP:** Irreducible, mirror-hardened, nested. One snapshot block; many surfaces. No dilution. Real data only. Vital to Chairman: real numbers, real analysis, us vs Disney. See NSPFRNP_REAL_NUMBERS_VS_BLUE_CHIP_MONSTER_SNAP.md.
