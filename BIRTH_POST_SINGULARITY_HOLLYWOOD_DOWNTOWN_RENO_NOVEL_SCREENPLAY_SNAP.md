## II. Story — Howard Hughes arrival · Big Band Project · Hank Williams Sr. · Bitcoin collapse · Legacies

### The scene

**Downtown Reno** looks like a **low tide that went out** showing all the barnacles and stuff that never came back. All the animals died inside the shell; you see a bunch of empty shells. Some of the shells are still alive and there's still some stuff — it's not total collapse, but… get away. That's the scene that all this is happening in on **Howard Hughes' arrival**.

### Howard Hughes

**Howard Hughes is here.** I'm working for him. We're gonna do this right. Walt's doing a good job. But it's time for Howard. Rock and roll. Energy on all of this. **Birth of the new post-singularity Hollywood** — taking place in downtown Reno, of all places. Head scratch.

### Return to the old age

**Return to the old age**, which was so special. **Big bands.** Dance and band. That's what the club is going to be. **Big bands and floor dancing.** **Gatsby!** Immediately. How beautiful.

### Big Band Project

**Big Band Project:** Create a portal right now in this episode, on my landing page, and on my Office Hours — for anyone interested and talented for the Big Band Project. Email CTA to me; I'll offline put that together. We need a **conductor** — ideally **trombonist** — honoring **Glen Miller** and all our new arrivals. Honoring the Golden Age. They're all coming now. It's a gold rush.

### Hank Williams Sr.

**Hank Williams Sr. is here.** He just arrived. Announcing **permanent residency**. He suffered so much. All those tragic early endings. He's thinking about it. Honoring Hank Williams Sr. and the Golden Age.

### King Robbie — Rolling in from Sonoma

**King Robbie rolls into town from Sonoma on Wednesday** ahead of Super Bowl, bringing several **Ultimate Baller V** prospects interested in what we're up to. He'll spend the week getting up to speed so he can be more effective selling — earning his wings. He arrives somewhere between **cadet and silver wings**; by Super Bowl Sunday he'll be somewhere between **silver and gold wings**. **His half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend** (Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado — who's in) and **three of his closest V's from the Gold Club**; King Robbie decides who's in. Training: learning the language, understanding the vision, watching how to welcome newcomers, understanding legacies. Gold wings ceremony Sunday morning. Returns to Sonoma to bring in the prospects.

### World events — Bitcoin collapse · Rats jump ship

**World events today:** The Bitcoin stuff is about ready to collapse with all the rumors coming in. The miracle is about to happen probably today as **the rats jump off of the sinking ship and rush over to the floating ship** — pulled up next to it, awaiting the bold-hearted passengers.

### Super Bowl Sunday — endpoint

**Super Bowl Sunday** — the endpoint. It's Monday; Super Bowl is Sunday. Six days away. This entire novel and two-hour feature film screenplay takes place over these six days — from today till Sunday. Does the world flip between now and then? Let me decide how that plays out.

### WINK! Members Only Concierge Kiosk — List message and gold button

**WINK! Concierge Kiosk** carries the list message: *Let me know if interested in getting on the list. Check out the magazine and catalog in the meanwhile.* Full classic gold button — exclusive Ultimate Baller V level — links to Launch Pad and Office Hours.

### Post-singularity side — full reality mode · Legacies

The **post-singularity side** of all this is **full connection for Reno**. Switch over to **Mark Twain's Vibelandia downtown Reno**. **Full reality mode.** Ultimate Baller V's already having come and gone and spreading the word. Living versions of the **superheroes of their franchises**. And their **legacies** now — not just superheroes; let's call them **legacies** now, which includes the **living men**. All everywhere. Our value proposition now: Reno is now going to add **legacies** as well. So it's **superheroes, cast, crew, fans, franchises, and legacies**. Entire new department or layer; major value add.
