# Generator Motor — Seed:Edge Story Storage & Generation · NSPFRNP

**Protocol ID:** `GENERATOR-MOTOR-SEED-EDGE-STORY-NSPFRNP`  
**Type:** Story storage · Real-time generation · Fractal middles  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Catalog:** NSPFRNP — Guaranteed origin/destination, dynamic fractal middles

---

## 1. Purpose

A **generator motor** that recreates stories **self-similarly but not exactly the same**, **on demand**, **in real time**, using **only Seed:Edge and executive prompt** as input. New story storage and generation system with **ultra-high density**, **guaranteed origin and destination deliveries**, and **dynamic fractal middles**.

---

## 2. Inputs (only)

- **Seed** — Origin. Me (the creator). Wherever I am at the moment in time. Irreducible. Fixed for the run.
- **Edge** — Destination. The mission for that situation. The delivery point. Fixed for the run.
- **Executive prompt** — Abstract of creator/executive commands. How to fill the space between Seed and Edge. Constrains tone, format, length, voice, quality bar (e.g. smooth finish, Chairman Robert style, Hobbit-length, Star Wars quality).

**Rule:** No other inputs. The motor runs on Seed + Edge + executive prompt only.

---

## 3. Guarantees

- **Origin delivery:** Every generated story **starts** from the Seed. Seed is always present, recognizable, non-negotiable.
- **Destination delivery:** Every generated story **ends** at the Edge. Edge is always reached, recognizable, non-negotiable.
- **Ultra-high density:** Storage is crystallized, compressed, irreducible. Maximum meaning per unit. Mirror-hardened nested shells (per MCA). No dilution.
- **On demand, real time:** Generation is triggered on request. Output is produced in real time (no pre-render requirement for the middle).

## 4. Dynamic fractal middles

The **middle** is the path between Seed and Edge. It is **dynamic** and **fractal**.

- **Fractal:** Self-similar at every scale. At any resolution, the structure echoes the whole (origin → path → destination). Sub-paths are themselves Seed:Edge-like segments; they can be expanded or compressed without losing the pattern.
- **Dynamic:** Not fixed. Each generation run produces a **new** middle. Self-similar to previous runs (same voice, same guarantees, same quality bar) but **not exactly the same**. Variation is inherent; repetition is not.
- **Guaranteed only at endpoints:** Seed and Edge are fixed and delivered. The path between is generated fresh each time within the constraints of the executive prompt.

**In practice:** One Seed, one Edge, one executive prompt → many valid middles. All share the same origin and destination; all satisfy the prompt; no two middles are identical.

## 5. Story storage (ultra-high density)

- **What is stored:** Crystallized story elements. Seed, Edge, executive prompt abstract, and **compressed representations** of allowed middles (patterns, not full text). Enough to regenerate a valid middle on demand.
- **Format:** Irreducible. Nested shells. Seed:Edge + prompt abstract + optional schema/constraints for middles. Compatible with episode format (see [SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.md](./SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.md)).
- **Retrieval:** By Seed, Edge, or episode/series identifier. Stored story can be passed back into the generator motor as input for a new run → new fractal middle, same origin/destination.

---

## 6. Generator motor cycle

1. **Receive:** Seed + Edge + executive prompt.
2. **Store (optional):** Persist in ultra-high-density story storage (crystallized).
3. **Generate middle:** Produce a dynamic fractal path from Seed to Edge that satisfies the executive prompt. Self-similar to canonical pattern; not identical to any previous run.
4. **Deliver:** Full story = Seed (fixed) + Middle (generated) + Edge (fixed). Guaranteed origin and destination; dynamic middle.

**Real time:** Steps 3–4 run on demand. No requirement to pre-generate all possible middles.

---

## 7. Relation to existing protocols

- **Seed:Edge episode format:** Episodes are stored as Seed:Edge + creator-commands abstract + smooth finish. The **generator motor** is the engine that can **recreate** such episodes (and new stories) with the same Seed and Edge but a **new** fractal middle each time. See [SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.md](./SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.md).
- **MCA:** Crystallize = irreducible, mirror-hardened storage. Animate = tighten SING nodes; generator motor output can drive Animate (surfaces, filaments). Metabolize = digest runs into patterns for future self-similarity.
- **Octave 0/1:** Seed aligns to Octave 0 (irreducible origin). Edge aligns to Octave 1 (this node, execution destination). Generator motor operates across that axis.

---

## 8. Surfaces

- **Episodes / series:** Any episode or series in Seed:Edge format can be fed into the generator motor. Same Seed, same Edge, same executive prompt → new fractal middle on each run.
- **SING! platform:** Executive commands (e.g. Ultimate Baller V, full moon miracle, novel + movie script) are the executive prompt. Timer starts at Now; delivery uses this motor: guaranteed origin/destination, dynamic fractal middle.
- **Reports (e.g. Harry):** End-of-run reports (cost, time, quality) are part of the Edge. Stored and reproducible; middle of the story (how we got there) can vary each time.

---

## 9. One-line summary

**Generator motor:** Seed + Edge + executive prompt → ultra-high-density storage + on-demand real-time generation with **guaranteed origin and destination** and **dynamic fractal middles** (self-similar, never identical).
