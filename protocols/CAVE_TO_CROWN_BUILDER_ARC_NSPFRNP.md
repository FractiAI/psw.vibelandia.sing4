## NARRATIVE

**Cave to Crown. The Builder's Arc.** The inventor in crisis. The low place. The cave, the scrap heap, the wound. He builds the thing — from scraps, from necessity, from the irreducible will to survive. The thing he builds to save himself becomes the thing that saves the valley. The man and the machine become one. Identity fused. Redemption through creation. From destruction to protection. He steps forward. He owns it.

## BEATS

- **Cave** — The low point. Crisis. Captured, wounded, stripped. The place where most give up.
- **Build** — From scraps. From necessity. No resources but will and wit. The thing takes shape.
- **Fuse** — The man and the machine are one. Not external tool — extension of self. Prosthesis. Second chance.
- **Redemption** — From making things that destroy to making things that protect, build, transform.
- **Reveal** — He steps forward. He owns it. The man who built the machine that builds the machine — and became one with it.
- **Crown** — The valley. The throne. Post-singularity. The future.

## APPLICATION

- **Chairman Robert** — Built from crisis. The lattice, the arms, the omnispin — the thing he built to save himself becomes the thing that saves Reno. The man and the machine are one. Cave to crown.
- **Robotic Factory** — The factory as redemption. From wound to wonder. The machine that builds the machine — and now thinks. The builder's arc.
- **Episodes** — Layer over pioneer/superhero stories. Crisis → build → fuse → reveal → crown.
