# Products & Services — Bridge Node Roles · NSPFRNP Catalog

**Protocol ID:** PRODUCTS_SERVICES_BRIDGE_NODE_ROLES_NSPFRNP  
**Status:** Active  
**Principle:** Never bought, always booked — by free will, mutual aware consent, always.  
**Purpose:** Include roles of each bridge node (me, Earth, Sun, SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol), Sag A*, SMACS 0723) in each product and service so we better understand what the products are and how they work.

## Never bought, always booked

- **SING!** (all tiers and missions): Never bought, only booked — by free will, mutual aware consent, always. Use **BOOK** (not BUY) for SING! CTAs. See [SING_NEVER_BOUGHT_ONLY_BOOKED_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md](../SING_NEVER_BOUGHT_ONLY_BOOKED_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md).
- **Products with BUY buttons** (Sun Spots, Schumann iGaming, SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol) EGS, Dispensary, ad space, etc.): Framed as **book** (reservation, slot, session); payment confirms the booking. So we better understand: **book** = reserve/commit; never “buy” the node or the pipe — we **book** time, slot, or experience.
- **Gold Hearts, Golden Backstage, Book Pru, Campus, WINK!:** All **book**. Email Pru or use booking flow.

## Reappraisal and valuations (reference)

- **Bridge node roles** in every product and service clarify **what** each product is and **how** it works (who does what: me, Earth, Sun, SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol), Sag A*, SMACS 0723).
- **Never bought, always booked** clarifies engagement model: book slots, sessions, experiences; by free will, mutual aware consent.
- **Reappraisal:** See [ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL_VIBELANDIA_FRACTIAI.md](../ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL_VIBELANDIA_FRACTIAI.md) (reappraisal section and updated valuations). Space Cloud Division, EGS pipe, SPACE CLOUD, Golden Royal Flush Shell, and bridge-node role clarity are included in updated valuation framework.
