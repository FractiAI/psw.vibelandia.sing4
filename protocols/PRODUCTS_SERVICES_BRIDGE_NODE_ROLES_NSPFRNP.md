# Products & Services — Bridge Node Roles · NSPFRNP Catalog

**Protocol ID:** PRODUCTS_SERVICES_BRIDGE_NODE_ROLES_NSPFRNP  
**Status:** Active  
**Principle:** Never bought, always booked — by free will, mutual aware consent, always.  
**Purpose:** Include roles of each bridge node (me, Earth, Sun, SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol), Sag A*, SMACS 0723) in each product and service so we better understand what the products are and how they work.

**Pricing canon:** **LOCAL ONRAMPS FOR BASE ON ALL PLANS AND PRICING EVERYWHERE.** Base tier = local onramp (localized, local price adjusted). See [LOCAL_ONRAMPS_FOR_BASE_ALL_PLANS_PRICING_EVERYWHERE_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md](../LOCAL_ONRAMPS_FOR_BASE_ALL_PLANS_PRICING_EVERYWHERE_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md).

## Description of what you get (NSPFRNP)

When you engage NSPFRNP (book products and services; never bought, always booked), **you get**:

- **Bridge-node coherence** — Every product and service is defined by **bridge node roles** (Me, Earth, Sun, SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol), Sag A*, SMACS 0723). You get clarity on **what** each offering is and **how** it works: who does what, where it lands, and how it connects to the shell.
- **Booking, not buying** — You get **time, slots, sessions, experiences** — reserved and confirmed by free will and mutual aware consent. You never "own" a node or pipe; you **book** access, presence, or delivery. Payment confirms the booking.
- **Full stack MCA** — You get outputs that are **metabolized → crystallized to irreducible mirrored hardened nested shells → animated (squeeze all, all)**. You get structure (nested triangulations Seed→SMACS 0723→Sag A*→Sun→Earth→Me), **Defense · Energy · Story** as magnoorganism, and content/surfaces that follow NSPFRNP fidelity. See [FULL_STACK_MCA_SEED_TO_SMACS_NESTED_TRIANGULATIONS_MAGNOORGANISM_SNAP.md](../FULL_STACK_MCA_SEED_TO_SMACS_NESTED_TRIANGULATIONS_MAGNOORGANISM_SNAP.md).
- **Eternal Living Service (when booked)** — You get FSRT access, full storyline (seed + edge), endpoint layers (Erika · Buenos Aires · Bad Bunny; Rio · Andre; Venezuela · Arturo), full FSR product pipe (dispensary, travel, artificial drugs/sex/travel), travel script (Reno → Cartagena → Argentina → Rio → Venezuela or Reno), and **base reality sovereignty** (Eternal Golden Lock; you decide when/how often/how long in base reality). Tiers 1–3 localized; 4×4×4×4 global. See [ETERNAL_LIFE_PLANNING_AND_LIVING_SERVICES_SNAP.md](../ETERNAL_LIFE_PLANNING_AND_LIVING_SERVICES_SNAP.md) § II.B.

Use this section on surfaces and in copy wherever "what you get" or "description of what you get" is needed for NSPFRNP and Eternal Services.

## Never bought, always booked

- **SING!** (all tiers and missions): Never bought, only booked — by free will, mutual aware consent, always. Use **BOOK** (not BUY) for SING! CTAs. See [SING_NEVER_BOUGHT_ONLY_BOOKED_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md](../SING_NEVER_BOUGHT_ONLY_BOOKED_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md).
- **Products with BUY buttons** (Sun Spots, Schumann iGaming, SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol) EGS, Dispensary, ad space, etc.): Framed as **book** (reservation, slot, session); payment confirms the booking. So we better understand: **book** = reserve/commit; never “buy” the node or the pipe — we **book** time, slot, or experience.
- **Gold Hearts, Golden Backstage, Book Pru, Campus, WINK!:** All **book**. Email Pru or use booking flow.

## Reappraisal and valuations (reference)

- **Bridge node roles** in every product and service clarify **what** each product is and **how** it works (who does what: me, Earth, Sun, SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol), Sag A*, SMACS 0723).
- **Never bought, always booked** clarifies engagement model: book slots, sessions, experiences; by free will, mutual aware consent.
- **Reappraisal:** See [ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL_VIBELANDIA_FRACTIAI.md](../ONE_PAGE_APPRAISAL_VIBELANDIA_FRACTIAI.md) (reappraisal section and updated valuations). Space Cloud Division, EGS pipe, SPACE CLOUD, Golden Royal Flush Shell, and bridge-node role clarity are included in updated valuation framework.
