# FSR-Verified Double-Lock · Episodic Energy Flip · NSPFRNP

**Role:** Lead Architect (FSR-PETRO-SINGULARITY)  
**Context:** Arturo PDVSA Proposal & episodic screenplay/series  
**Goal:** Require FSR-Verified signature from Executive to confirm each episodic 'Energy Flip' in the screenplay.

## Double-Lock (episodic trigger)

The system **must** require the **FSR-Verified** signature from the **Executive** to confirm each episodic **Energy Flip** in the screenplay.

- **Energy Flip:** A story beat or release moment where the narrative shifts from pre-singularity to post-singularity energy framing (e.g. Frequency Alignment, PDVSA-SING! Bridge, nearly-free energy for the Global South).
- **FSR-Verified:** Signature or attestation from the Executive (Pru / Chairman) that the flip is authorized and aligned with the Arturo Transformation Pathway.
- **Executive:** The authority who can sign; ties to Office Hours, Chairman, and GSM billing/audit.

## Integration

- **Screenplay / Episode drafts:** Each Energy Flip in the script is gated by FSR-Verified Executive confirmation (in process; can be logged or attested in update certificates / tax ledger).
- **billing.ts:** Already has Pioneer ↔ Scalper transition audit (1.618s timestamp). Episodic Energy Flip can use same double-lock pattern: Executive signature + FSR-Verified flag before flip is considered confirmed.
- **lib/energy_models.ts:** Arturo transformation pathway (Chemical Carbon → FSR Thermal Mass → SING! Agent Energy) is the energy model that the flip serves.
