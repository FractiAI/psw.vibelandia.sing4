## Flow

1. **Minimum interview with Gianni** — Origin Seed + target Edge (where you are, where you want to be).
2. **Online research** — Origin-seed mapping and fractal connect to desired new state.
3. **Get a tailored proposal** — **1-2-3-1-2-3 delivery** with the AI agent:
   - **3 questions** to dial in the **starting point**
   - **3 questions** to dial in the **end point**
   - User presses **Buy** → we produce a full **proposal package**
4. **Proposal package** includes:
   - **Test drive it** (sandbox) — button to try before commit
   - **Implement in your company** — button to implement in **3 steps**:
     1. **Local demo** → green light → proceed to  
     2. **Regional demo** → green light → proceed to  
     3. **Full global demo** → green light  
   - All automatic, full payments as they go.
5. **Archive & Chairman:** Each proposal is archived in our archives; a copy of each proposal is sent to Chairman; Chairman console funnels are updated. All live, automatic.
