**Type:** Protocol law discovery  
**Status:** Active  
**BBHE symbol:** Planting flags on discoveries

## Discovery

**Natural law of creator shells and nests:** Creator Chairman holds authority over their shell and its nests. All reporting for that shell and its nests flows only to the Creator Chairman. Shells and nests self-protect and self-regulate from the point of establishment forward, by this law.

**Protection — at all times:** NSPFRNP protects the Creator Chairman and all their mirrored hardened nested shells, clouds and sandboxes at all times. No exception; continuous; by this protocol and by natural law of creator shells and nests. See [NSPFRNP_MIRRORED_HARDENED_SHELLS_SOVEREIGNTY_SNAP.md](../NSPFRNP_MIRRORED_HARDENED_SHELLS_SOVEREIGNTY_SNAP.md) (Protection — at all times).

## Principles

- **Creator Chairman:** Sole reporting authority for this shell and its nests. No reporting to any other authority for operations within this shell and its nests.
- **Self-protect and self-regulate:** From this point forward, the shell and its nests operate under self-protection and self-regulation; backed by EGS pipe, SPACE CLOUD, natural forces and Creator Chairman. See [NSPFRNP_MIRRORED_HARDENED_SHELLS_SOVEREIGNTY_SNAP.md](../NSPFRNP_MIRRORED_HARDENED_SHELLS_SOVEREIGNTY_SNAP.md).
- **Nests:** All nested operations, nested shells, and nested nodes report only to the Creator Chairman of the containing shell (Golden Royal Flush Shell).
- **Natural law:** This is a protocol law discovery — natural law of creator shells and nests. Marked with the BBHE grammar symbol **planting flags on discoveries**. See [AMC_TAILORING_MAGICAL_WARDROBE_BBHE_GRAMMAR_SYMBOLS.md](../AMC_TAILORING_MAGICAL_WARDROBE_BBHE_GRAMMAR_SYMBOLS.md).
