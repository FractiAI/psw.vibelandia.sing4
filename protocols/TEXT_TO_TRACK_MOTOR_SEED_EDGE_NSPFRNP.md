# Text-to-Track Motor — Seed:Edge · NSPFRNP

**Protocol ID:** `TEXT-TO-TRACK-MOTOR-SEED-EDGE-NSPFRNP`  
**Type:** Track generation · Production WAV · Playlist & catalog  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Catalog:** NSPFRNP — Clean, copyright-free, our motor only

---

## 1. Purpose

A **text-to-track motor** that turns **songs in text** into **production-ready WAV** using **only Seed, Edge, and executive instruction** — no third-party samples, no copyrighted material. Same motor as story generation: Seed (origin) + Edge (destination) + executive prompt (how to fill). Output is a **beautiful production WAV** with **Download** and **auto-save to playlist and catalog** as NSPFRNP.

---

## 2. Inputs (only)

- **Songs in text** — Lyrics, title, or song description. The raw content to be turned into a track.
- **Seed** — Origin. Octave, root, or starting point. Fixed for the run. Irreducible.
- **Edge** — Destination. Style, duration, mood, or delivery point. Fixed for the run.
- **Executive instruction** — How to fill the space: BPM, tone, density, “production-ready,” “ballad,” “Reggaetón,” etc.

**Rule:** No other inputs. The motor runs on songs-in-text + Seed + Edge + executive instruction only. All audio is **generated by our same motor** (synthesis from Seed:Edge). **Copyright-free.** We do not use any third-party artist names, samples, or copyrighted material. Full respect for all copyright. Studio-quality output from our motor only.

---

## 3. Guarantees

- **Origin delivery:** Every track **starts** from the Seed (e.g. root note, octave).
- **Destination delivery:** Every track **ends** at the Edge (e.g. style, duration, outtro).
- **Clean / copyright-free:** No samples, no loops, no third-party audio. Synthesis only. Our motor. Safe for distribution and catalog.
- **Production-ready WAV:** Output is a single WAV file suitable for playlist, catalog, and downstream use.

---

## 4. Outputs

- **Production WAV file** — Beautiful, finished track. Downloadable.
- **Track = master studio musician (holographic name) and their instrument** — Not by instrument only — by master studio musician and their instrument. Each track (1–12) is one master studio musician, named with a best-fit holographic name, and their instrument (e.g. Sera · Bass, Kael · Drums, Nola · Pad, Lyra · Lead, Rune · Keys, Vex · Strings, Bram · Brass, Echo · Perc, Zephyr · Synth, Orin · Vox, Flux · FX, Maestro · Producer/Conductor). **Squeeze all to master musicians** under **Hero Rick's exec producer direction**; Hero Rick reports to **Hero Jo**; Hero Jo reports to **Chairman Creator**. See [SING_NODIFY_TEXT_TO_STUDIO_SONG_ENGINE_NSPFRNP_NESTS_SNAP.md](../SING_NODIFY_TEXT_TO_STUDIO_SONG_ENGINE_NSPFRNP_NESTS_SNAP.md).
- **Download button** — One-click download per track.
- **Auto-save to playlist** — Generated tracks are added to the session playlist (NSPFRNP).
- **Auto-save to catalog** — Tracks are recorded in the catalog in NSPFRNP format (entry + metadata including musician name and instrument).

---

## 5. Motor cycle

1. **Receive:** Songs in text + Seed + Edge + executive instruction.
2. **Generate:** Render audio from Seed:Edge + text (deterministic or fractal middle from same inputs). Synthesis only. No external assets.
3. **Export:** Production WAV (e.g. 44.1 kHz, stereo, 16-bit).
4. **Deliver:** Download button + add to playlist + add to catalog (NSPFRNP).

## 6. Relation to existing protocols

- **Generator Motor (story):** Same idea — Seed + Edge + executive prompt → guaranteed origin/destination, dynamic middle. Here the “story” is the **track**; the middle is the **arrangement** (melody, rhythm, texture).
- **Seed:Edge episode format:** Track metadata (title, lyrics, Seed, Edge) can be stored in the same ultra-high-density way; playback = WAV.
- **Music Studio · Catalog:** All generated tracks flow into the Music Studio playlist and `catalogs/music/` in NSPFRNP format. Layer 0 = text; Layer 1 = production WAV.
- **Music molds:** Use [GOLDEN_BACKDOOR_MUSIC_MOLDS_SNAP.md](../GOLDEN_BACKDOOR_MUSIC_MOLDS_SNAP.md) — new music SNAPs to mold music; vibe types (air pumping, big boom bounce, tribal downbeat, touchdown vibe bang), structure, Spanglish, songs as tags and brands.

## 7. Surfaces

- **Text-to-Track Motor UI** — Single page: text input, Seed/Edge, **Team (studio or concert)** selector, executive instruction, **1–12 tracks** selector, Generate, Download WAV (one per track), Playlist, Catalog entry. The artist creator gives exec instruction to his studio or concert team (new options: studio, concert).
- **Music Studio / Jukebox** — Playlist and catalog list generated tracks.
- **Catalog (NSPFRNP)** — Each track gets a catalog entry (title, Seed, Edge, WAV filename, date, executive instruction).

---

## 8. One-line summary

**Text-to-track motor:** Songs in text + Seed + Edge + executive instruction → **copyright-free production WAV** (our motor only) + **Download** + **auto-save to playlist and catalog** as NSPFRNP.
