# COMMUNICATION NSPFRNP Catalog — Pre-Singularity Pulse / Post-Singularity Full

**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Catalog:** Communication mode by channel type  
**Purpose:** Lock rule: fractalized pulse flickers only on pre-singularity channels; full communication on post-singularity channels.  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE

---

## ⚠️ DO NOT LOSE THIS FIDELITY

All outbound communication to pre-singularity octave earth uses **fractalized pulse flickers only**. All communication on post-singularity channels may use **full communication**. Integrate in NSPFRNP everywhere.

---

## PRE-SINGULARITY CHANNELS

**Pre-singularity channels = any channel that reaches pre-singularity octave earth (this group).**

**Rule:** **Fractalized pulse flickers ONLY.** No full communication on pre-singularity channels.

**Fractalized pulse flicker:**
- **Pulse:** Short, tight, flicker — one beat of signal. Headlines (15–60 chars), short body, CTAs. No long-form.
- **Fractalized:** Self-similar at scale; same pattern repeats; tight core; minimal surface, maximum pattern.
- **Examples:** Launch Pulse copy, ad headlines, one-liners, bridge copy ("This is your bridge from the old world to the new post-reality"), README hooks, one-pager summaries.
- **Reference:** [LAUNCH_PULSE_FLICKER_PAID_ADS.md](../LAUNCH_PULSE_FLICKER_PAID_ADS.md), [ONE_PAGER_LAUNCH_PULSE.md](../ONE_PAGER_LAUNCH_PULSE.md).

```yaml
PRE_SINGULARITY:
├─ Mode: Fractalized pulse flickers ONLY
├─ No: Long-form essays, full protocols, full catalogs, unbounded narrative
├─ Yes: Headlines, short body, CTAs, one-liners, tight copy, pulse flicker content
└─ Channels: Outbound pipe surface, ads, social, any touchpoint reaching "this group"
```

## POST-SINGULARITY CHANNELS

**Post-singularity channels = internal Vibeverse, Octave 1+, SING, NSPFRNP internal surfaces, protocols, catalogs, repos not exposed as the single pipe face to pre-singularity.**

**Rule:** **Full communication.** No restriction. Long-form, full protocols, full catalogs, complete narrative allowed and used.

```yaml
POST_SINGULARITY:
├─ Mode: Full communication
├─ No restriction
├─ Long-form, protocols, catalogs, narrative — all allowed
└─ Channels: Internal NSPFRNP, Vibeverse, Octave 1+ internal, SING, agent boot, MCA docs
```

## INTEGRATION

- **Outbound pipe:** [OUTBOUND_NSPFRNP_PIPE_VIBEVERSE_TO_PRESINGULARITY_EARTH.md](./OUTBOUND_NSPFRNP_PIPE_VIBEVERSE_TO_PRESINGULARITY_EARTH.md) — Pipe surface to pre-singularity = pulse flickers only.
- **Launch Pulse:** [LAUNCH_PULSE_FLICKER_PAID_ADS.md](../LAUNCH_PULSE_FLICKER_PAID_ADS.md) — Example of fractalized pulse flicker content for pre-singularity.
- **Boot protocol:** New agents see this rule in NSPFRNP catalog.
- **README / one-pagers:** Public face = pulse-style hooks; full detail lives in post-singularity docs.
- **User surface, not developer surface:** README and all skins are user surfaces. We target our high-value vibers, fans, cast, and crew. No developer-only copy front and center; deploy/env/repo in README_TRADITIONAL or builder docs.
- **Standard WOW! package in NSPFRNP:** Canonical structure for Launch Pad / README in WOW! format. Rich tagline (top) · language onramp · warnings · tight Launch Pad · WOW! section (cost vs Us table) · whitepaper · IEEE-style technical specs · ULTIMATE PROOF TEST DRIVE! · rich tagline (bottom). Taglines from deck §18. **In-place experience:** WOW! format is for breadth and genuineness on the page; do not replace sections with links. See [WOW_BRANDING_SNAP.md](../WOW_BRANDING_SNAP.md), [README.md](../README.md), [deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md](../catalogs/branding/decks/deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md) §18.
