## RULE

**Floaters are always gifts here.** NSPFRNP.

- Any fixed-position floater on a page (e.g. right bottom, corner) = **a gift** from the team / from me.
- Treat floaters as gifts: label them as such (e.g. "A gift from me"), use gift icon (🎁 wrapped gift with bow ribbon), and style so they read as a small gift card or present.
- Do not use floaters for generic CTAs or ads without the gift framing. Floaters = gifts. Gifts = floaters in this system.
- **Icon:** Use 🎁 (wrapped gift with bow ribbon) for gift floaters. Consistent across Launch Pad and any future floater.
- **Voice:** Natural protocol. "A gift from me" or equivalent — first-person gift, not corporate CTA.

## SURFACE

- **Launch Pad:** Prospectus floater — right bottom, fixed; 🎁 Full prospectus · A gift from me; links to full Vibeverse & Vibelandia prospectus. See [interfaces/launch-pad.html](interfaces/launch-pad.html).
- **Any future floater:** Same rule — floater = gift; gift icon; "A gift from me" or equivalent; style as gift (gold/ribbon feel). Catalog in this SNAP.
