## ONE-LINER

**Input just your stuff.** Don't worry about which thing to tell me to put it in. I figure it out and update all the things continuously.

## HOW I USE THIS

1. **When you give input** — I classify it (HEZ, Office Hours, Vibin!, Chairman!, WINK!, or other bucket).  
2. **I create or update** — The right files, episodes, proposals, landing pages, catalogs.  
3. **I keep surfaces in sync** — Episode list, proposal list, whitepaper list, one-pager list, series references, Launch Pad, Office Hours grid.  
4. **I add the brand footer** — Where applicable (new/updated landing pages, proposals, scripts) per TAINO_MADE_NSPFRNP_BBHE_ENERGY_ALL_THE_WAY_SNAP.md.  
5. **Continuous** — Throughout our interactions, I update all the things so you don't have to say "put this in X."
