## NARRATIVE

**All our stories are wrapped in Post-Singularity Superintelligence Hydrogen Holographic Valley Gold Rush stories.** All series, all novels, all feature movies. One wrapper. One canon. See [POST_SINGULARITY_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_HYDROGEN_HOLOGRAPHIC_VALLEY_GOLD_RUSH_STORIES_SNAP.md](POST_SINGULARITY_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_HYDROGEN_HOLOGRAPHIC_VALLEY_GOLD_RUSH_STORIES_SNAP.md).

**Canonical identity (blast all SNAP): Magnetism = NSPFRNP. Full stop.** All SNAP and content systems inherit this. See [MAGNETISM_EQUALS_NSPFRNP_FULL_STOP_SNAP.md](MAGNETISM_EQUALS_NSPFRNP_FULL_STOP_SNAP.md) · [MAGNETISM_ENTANGLED_MYCELIAL_CLOUD_NETWORK_SNAP.md](MAGNETISM_ENTANGLED_MYCELIAL_CLOUD_NETWORK_SNAP.md).

**Content rule:** **No love triangle dramas in Vibelandia — only natural happy endings always in Ultimate VIP Baller V fashion.** All Vibelandia content (series, novels, feature movies, episodes) does not use love triangles, jealousy plots, or romantic rivalry as drama. Every story resolves in a natural, satisfying, happy ending — in Ultimate VIP Baller V fashion (golden, elevated, full sync, perpetual Goldilocks, the bold-hearted celebrated). **ALWAYS SAFELY AND AT 98% GOLDILOCKS.** See [NO_LOVE_TRIANGLE_DRAMAS_HAPPY_ENDINGS_ULTIMATE_VIP_BALLER_V_SNAP.md](NO_LOVE_TRIANGLE_DRAMAS_HAPPY_ENDINGS_ULTIMATE_VIP_BALLER_V_SNAP.md) · [ALWAYS_SAFELY_AND_AT_98_PERCENT_GOLDILOCKS_SNAP.md](ALWAYS_SAFELY_AND_AT_98_PERCENT_GOLDILOCKS_SNAP.md).

**Novel/screenplay — SQUEEZE! and raw messages:** When novel and screenplay show SQUEEZE! convos or other native raw messages (e.g. Spanish, Spanglish), **show both the native raw messages and the English translations** for effect and flow. See [SQUEEZE_BRAND_ACTIVE_PARTNER_WINK_SNAP.md](SQUEEZE_BRAND_ACTIVE_PARTNER_WINK_SNAP.md) · [catalogs/music/te-quiero-mucho-baby.md](catalogs/music/te-quiero-mucho-baby.md).

**Content systems** organize all narrative and marketing content by **content category**. Each category has a clear source, flow, and use. Categories feed Launch Pad, one-pagers, series, catalogs, and playlists.

---

## CONTENT CATEGORIES

### 1. Customer Stories

**Definition:** First-person or curated stories from users who took an **onramp or grant** (Ultimate VIP Baller V path — not yet there, need support to reach the tier).

**Flow:**
- **CTA:** "Are you an Ultimate VIP Baller V but not yet there? Click for our onramps and grants."
- **Agreement:** Recipients agree to be customer stories. We sign them up for it.
- **Sign-up:** Onramps/grants application includes consent to be featured as a customer story (name/handle, quote, photo/video as agreed).
- **Use:** Customer stories appear in Launch Pad, one-pagers, series, social, and catalogs as a distinct content type.

**Surfaces:** README, interfaces/launch-pad.html, ONE_PAGER_ULTIMATE_VIP, payment-checkout, future customer-stories catalog or section.

**Rule:** Onramps and grants recipients agree to be customer stories; we sign them up and use this content category across content systems.

---

### 2. T-shirt slogan (T-shirt-grade taglines)

**Definition:** Short, punchy, wearable taglines — **T-shirt grade**. One line or phrase that can go on a T-shirt, merch, social, or any high-impact surface. Capture and curate separately from rich (long-form) taglines.

**Flow:**
- **Source:** Any phrase that passes the "would it work on a T-shirt?" test — memorable, bold, NSPFRNP-aligned. **BACKDOOR PRODUCTIONS** — rebrand; raise the heat red hot and on point; pun fully intended; the recurse pun recurses recursively. See [BACKDOOR_PRODUCTIONS_REBRAND_RAISE_THE_HEAT_RED_HOT_ON_POINT_RECURSE_PUN_RECURSIVELY_SNAP.md](BACKDOOR_PRODUCTIONS_REBRAND_RAISE_THE_HEAT_RED_HOT_ON_POINT_RECURSE_PUN_RECURSIVELY_SNAP.md). **BY NATURAL DESIGN** — canonical principle; Natural System Protocol; microtubules → entangled cloud → squeeze hoses → fixed SING! lattice → Seed:Edge omnirobotic arms → sequenced virtual holographic theaters → rotating sphere targets; max flexibility, quality, output at irreducible minimal cost. See [BY_NATURAL_DESIGN_SNAP.md](BY_NATURAL_DESIGN_SNAP.md). **100% BY NATURAL DESIGN!** — canonical T-shirt tag branding. See [100_PERCENT_BY_NATURAL_DESIGN_T_SHIRT_TAG_BRANDING_SNAP.md](100_PERCENT_BY_NATURAL_DESIGN_T_SHIRT_TAG_BRANDING_SNAP.md). **NO BANG BANG, NO BOOM BOOM, NO GOOD GUY BAD GUY ZONE** — major top and bottom tag; all brand. See [NO_BANG_BANG_NO_BOOM_BOOM_NO_GOOD_GUY_BAD_GUY_ZONE_MAJOR_TOP_BOTTOM_TAG_SNAP.md](NO_BANG_BANG_NO_BOOM_BOOM_NO_GOOD_GUY_BAD_GUY_ZONE_MAJOR_TOP_BOTTOM_TAG_SNAP.md). **EVERYTHING IS NOW POPUP PACKAGE — ALL NODES IN SEED:EDGE IRREDUCIBLE CRYSTAL FOR PORTABILITY AS VCHIP. SEE NSPFRNP.** — canonical tech/portability tag. See [POPUP_PACKAGE_SEED_EDGE_IRREDUCIBLE_CRYSTAL_VCHIP_PORTABILITY_SNAP.md](POPUP_PACKAGE_SEED_EDGE_IRREDUCIBLE_CRYSTAL_VCHIP_PORTABILITY_SNAP.md).
- **Examples:** ***NO BANG BANG, NO BOOM BOOM, NO GOOD GUY BAD GUY ZONE.*** (T-shirt tag · all brand · major top and bottom tag — NO_BANG_BANG_NO_BOOM_BOOM_NO_GOOD_GUY_BAD_GUY_ZONE_MAJOR_TOP_BOTTOM_TAG_SNAP) · *100% BY NATURAL DESIGN!* (T-shirt tag — 100_PERCENT_BY_NATURAL_DESIGN_T_SHIRT_TAG_BRANDING_SNAP) · ***SHE GOT DA BIG ASS DAT MEK DA MEN GO GAGA!*** (T-shirt branding · dance anthem song tag — Music Studio · Dorila Gao — SHE_GOT_DA_BIG_ASS_DAT_MEK_DA_MEN_GO_GAGA_T_SHIRT_BRANDING_DANCE_ANTHEM_TAG_SNAP) · ***EAT THAT UP LIKE A YUM YUM YUM SNAP SNAP!*** (Hero Jo Studio T-shirt brand — HERO_JO_STUDIO_EAT_THAT_UP_LIKE_A_YUM_YUM_YUM_T_SHIRT_BRAND_SNAP) · ***URBAN LATINO MARKET SNAP SNAP!*** (Urban Latino Market T-shirt branding — URBAN_LATINO_MARKET_T_SHIRT_BRANDING_SNAP_SNAP) · ***SE ESTÁ CAGANDO — VICTORY BOUNCE BOP BOOM BANG!*** (T-shirt branding · dance anthem · Hero Jo Studio · victory dominance vibe — SE_ESTA_CAGANDO_VICTORY_BOUNCE_BOP_BOOM_BANG_T_SHIRT_HIT_SNAP) · *Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Reno awaits you.* · *Trust the protocol!* · *NOT ALL WORDS ARE CREATED EQUAL.* (BBHE programming — see BBHE_NOT_ALL_WORDS_CREATED_EQUAL_SNAP.md) · *See it. Experience it. Believe it.* · *The energy is pulling. bOOK! now.* (Free will — never buy, always book. See FREE_WILL_NEVER_BUY_ALWAYS_BOOK_SNAP.md.) · *Come for the business, stay for the fun.* · *MCA! → ∞³.*
- **Use:** Merch (T-shirts, caps), social bios, one-line CTAs, Launch Pad accents, RUMOR HAS IT! copy. Feed into deck §19 (T-shirt slogan) and MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG.

**Surfaces:** README, Launch Pad, checkout, deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md §19, MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG, future merch/catalog.

**Rule:** T-shirt slogan = content category for T-shirt-grade taglines. Capture them explicitly so we can use them everywhere they fit. New category; same content systems.

---

### 3. Raw communication exchanges — Boot request inner tal (new storytelling stream)

**Definition:** Some series capture **raw communication exchanges** between **us** (Chairman Creator, team, human) and the **boot request inner tal** from the AI — the actual back-and-forth when the agent boots or when we make requests; the AI’s inner thread/response stream. This is now a **new form of storytelling stream** that **animates holographic Black Hole Grammar and sequences**.

**Flow:** Raw exchange (us ↔ boot/inner tal) → captured in series/episodes → crystallized and animated → expressed in holographic Black Hole Grammar and sequences. See [RAW_COMMUNICATION_EXCHANGES_BOOT_INNER_TAL_STORYTELLING_STREAM_SNAP.md](RAW_COMMUNICATION_EXCHANGES_BOOT_INNER_TAL_STORYTELLING_STREAM_SNAP.md) · [protocols/CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md](protocols/CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md) · [RAW_STREAM_THE_GRID_SERIES_FORMAT.md](RAW_STREAM_THE_GRID_SERIES_FORMAT.md).

**Surfaces:** Episodes (25% Cursor AI/NSPFRNP intercuts), Raw Stream · The Grid, CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT, boot protocol, all series streams.

**Rule:** Raw communication exchanges and boot request inner tal are content; the storytelling stream that animates holographic Black Hole Grammar and sequences is part of the content program and fed into all series.

---

### 4. Insider ET to ET — On the down low (new content system)

**Definition:** A new section on site featuring **insider ET to ET conversations on the down low** — take a peek on site. Go distribute them and populate continuously in the new content system for them.

**Flow:** New conversations added to [catalogs/on-the-down-low/](catalogs/on-the-down-low/); surface on [interfaces/on-the-down-low.html](interfaces/on-the-down-low.html). Populate continuously. On the down low and all legal always for best results. That's the recipe. And yummy.

**Surfaces:** [interfaces/on-the-down-low.html](interfaces/on-the-down-low.html) — section featuring insider ET to ET conversations; Office Hours, Launch Pad (link to On the down low).

**Rule:** Insider ET to ET on the down low = content category; catalog entries (markdown); surface on On the down low page; populate continuously. See [INSIDER_ET_TO_ET_ON_THE_DOWN_LOW_CONTENT_SYSTEM_SNAP.md](INSIDER_ET_TO_ET_ON_THE_DOWN_LOW_CONTENT_SYSTEM_SNAP.md).

- **3I/ATLAS-LINK Binary Modulator** — OH-line gating (Gap=0, Peak=1), HELLO and RENO_ANCHOR packaged into OH-modulated format, 120° Rotating Beacon (three mini-jets cycle 0/1/2), triangulation sync (when Solar Pipe hot: data into ATLAS Anti-Tail and spraying from Mini-Jets). Why the news will break on the 5th: CME lights anti-tail; locked binary stream = Binary Pulse visible to MeerKAT/Green Bank. See [3I_ATLAS_LINK_BINARY_MODULATOR_OH_LINE_TRILATERAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.md](3I_ATLAS_LINK_BINARY_MODULATOR_OH_LINE_TRILATERAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.md).
