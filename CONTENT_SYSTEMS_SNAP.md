# CONTENT SYSTEMS SNAP — Content Categories & Types

**Snap ID:** `CONTENT-SYSTEMS-SNAP`  
**Type:** NSPFRNP Content Systems / Content Categories SNAP  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Date:** January 29, 2026

---

## NARRATIVE

**All our stories are wrapped in Post-Singularity Superintelligence Hydrogen Holographic Valley Gold Rush stories.** All series, all novels, all feature movies. One wrapper. One canon. See [POST_SINGULARITY_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_HYDROGEN_HOLOGRAPHIC_VALLEY_GOLD_RUSH_STORIES_SNAP.md](POST_SINGULARITY_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_HYDROGEN_HOLOGRAPHIC_VALLEY_GOLD_RUSH_STORIES_SNAP.md).

**Content systems** organize all narrative and marketing content by **content category**. Each category has a clear source, flow, and use. Categories feed Launch Pad, one-pagers, series, catalogs, and playlists.

---

## CONTENT CATEGORIES

### 1. Customer Stories

**Definition:** First-person or curated stories from users who took an **onramp or grant** (Ultimate VIP Baller V path — not yet there, need support to reach the tier).

**Flow:**
- **CTA:** "Are you an Ultimate VIP Baller V but not yet there? Click for our onramps and grants."
- **Agreement:** Recipients agree to be customer stories. We sign them up for it.
- **Sign-up:** Onramps/grants application includes consent to be featured as a customer story (name/handle, quote, photo/video as agreed).
- **Use:** Customer stories appear in Launch Pad, one-pagers, series, social, and catalogs as a distinct content type.

**Surfaces:** README, interfaces/launch-pad.html, ONE_PAGER_ULTIMATE_VIP, payment-checkout, future customer-stories catalog or section.

**Rule:** Onramps and grants recipients agree to be customer stories; we sign them up and use this content category across content systems.

---

### 2. T-shirt slogan (T-shirt-grade taglines)

**Definition:** Short, punchy, wearable taglines — **T-shirt grade**. One line or phrase that can go on a T-shirt, merch, social, or any high-impact surface. Capture and curate separately from rich (long-form) taglines.

**Flow:**
- **Source:** Any phrase that passes the "would it work on a T-shirt?" test — memorable, bold, NSPFRNP-aligned.
- **Examples:** *Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Reno awaits you.* · *Trust the protocol!* · *NOT ALL WORDS ARE CREATED EQUAL.* (BBHE programming — see BBHE_NOT_ALL_WORDS_CREATED_EQUAL_SNAP.md) · *See it. Experience it. Believe it.* · *The energy is pulling. BUY! now.* · *Come for the business, stay for the fun.* · *MCA! → ∞³.*
- **Use:** Merch (T-shirts, caps), social bios, one-line CTAs, Launch Pad accents, RUMOR HAS IT! copy. Feed into deck §19 (T-shirt slogan) and MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG.

**Surfaces:** README, Launch Pad, checkout, deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md §19, MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG, future merch/catalog.

**Rule:** T-shirt slogan = content category for T-shirt-grade taglines. Capture them explicitly so we can use them everywhere they fit. New category; same content systems.

---

### 3. Raw communication exchanges — Boot request inner tal (new storytelling stream)

**Definition:** Some series capture **raw communication exchanges** between **us** (Chairman Creator, team, human) and the **boot request inner tal** from the AI — the actual back-and-forth when the agent boots or when we make requests; the AI’s inner thread/response stream. This is now a **new form of storytelling stream** that **animates holographic Black Hole Grammar and sequences**.

**Flow:** Raw exchange (us ↔ boot/inner tal) → captured in series/episodes → crystallized and animated → expressed in holographic Black Hole Grammar and sequences. See [RAW_COMMUNICATION_EXCHANGES_BOOT_INNER_TAL_STORYTELLING_STREAM_SNAP.md](RAW_COMMUNICATION_EXCHANGES_BOOT_INNER_TAL_STORYTELLING_STREAM_SNAP.md) · [protocols/CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md](protocols/CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md) · [RAW_STREAM_THE_GRID_SERIES_FORMAT.md](RAW_STREAM_THE_GRID_SERIES_FORMAT.md).

**Surfaces:** Episodes (25% Cursor AI/NSPFRNP intercuts), Raw Stream · The Grid, CONVERSATIONS_AS_CONTENT, boot protocol, all series streams.

**Rule:** Raw communication exchanges and boot request inner tal are content; the storytelling stream that animates holographic Black Hole Grammar and sequences is part of the content program and fed into all series.

---

### 4. Other content categories (existing)

- **Series / Episodes** — Happy Ending Zones, season one, daily countdown. See REALITY_SERIES_FORMAT.md, SEASON_ONE_*.
- **One-pagers** — Campus, WINK!, SING!, Launch, Ultimate VIP, Day/Weekly/Monthly Pass, etc.
- **Launch Pulse / Ads** — Fractalized pulse flickers for pre-singularity channels. See LAUNCH_PULSE_FLICKER_PAID_ADS.md.
- **Catalogs & playlists** — Character layering, Things to Do, Escapes, Dispensary, Happy Ending Zones catalog. See CHARACTER_LAYERING_CONTENT_ENRICHMENT_SNAP.md.
- **Whitepaper / IEEE / Chairman metrics** — Technical and proof content. Real numbers and % comparisons vs blue chip only — no fluffy. See WHITEPAPER_*, WOW_BRANDING_SNAP.md, NSPFRNP_REAL_NUMBERS_VS_BLUE_CHIP_MONSTER_SNAP.md.
- **Proposals SNAP** — Enterprise/community proposals (I CAN DO THIS FOR YOUR BUSINESS). See BUSINESS_OFFER.md, WOW_BRANDING_SNAP.md.
