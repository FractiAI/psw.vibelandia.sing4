## CONTENT CATEGORIES

### 1. Customer Stories

**Definition:** First-person or curated stories from users who took an **onramp or grant** (Ultimate VIP Baller C path — not yet there, need support to reach the tier).

**Flow:**
- **CTA:** "Are you an Ultimate VIP Baller C but not yet there? Click for our onramps and grants."
- **Agreement:** Recipients agree to be customer stories. We sign them up for it.
- **Sign-up:** Onramps/grants application includes consent to be featured as a customer story (name/handle, quote, photo/video as agreed).
- **Use:** Customer stories appear in Launch Pad, one-pagers, series, social, and catalogs as a distinct content type.

**Surfaces:** README, interfaces/launch-pad.html, ONE_PAGER_ULTIMATE_VIP, payment-checkout, future customer-stories catalog or section.

**Rule:** Onramps and grants recipients agree to be customer stories; we sign them up and use this content category across content systems.
