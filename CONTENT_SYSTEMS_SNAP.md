## NARRATIVE

**Content systems** organize all narrative and marketing content by **content category**. Each category has a clear source, flow, and use. Categories feed Launch Pad, one-pagers, series, catalogs, and playlists.

## CONTENT CATEGORIES

### 1. Customer Stories

**Definition:** First-person or curated stories from users who took an **onramp or grant** (Ultimate VIP Baller C path — not yet there, need support to reach the tier).

**Flow:**
- **CTA:** "Are you an Ultimate VIP Baller C but not yet there? Click for our onramps and grants."
- **Agreement:** Recipients agree to be customer stories. We sign them up for it.
- **Sign-up:** Onramps/grants application includes consent to be featured as a customer story (name/handle, quote, photo/video as agreed).
- **Use:** Customer stories appear in Launch Pad, one-pagers, series, social, and catalogs as a distinct content type.

**Surfaces:** README, interfaces/launch-pad.html, ONE_PAGER_ULTIMATE_VIP, payment-checkout, future customer-stories catalog or section.

**Rule:** Onramps and grants recipients agree to be customer stories; we sign them up and use this content category across content systems.

### 2. T-shirt slogan (T-shirt-grade taglines)

**Definition:** Short, punchy, wearable taglines — **T-shirt grade**. One line or phrase that can go on a T-shirt, merch, social, or any high-impact surface. Capture and curate separately from rich (long-form) taglines.

**Flow:**
- **Source:** Any phrase that passes the "would it work on a T-shirt?" test — memorable, bold, NSPFRNP-aligned.
- **Examples:** *Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers. Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Reno awaits you.* · *Trust the protocol!* · *NOT ALL WORDS ARE CREATED EQUAL.* (BBHE programming — see BBHE_NOT_ALL_WORDS_CREATED_EQUAL_SNAP.md) · *See it. Experience it. Believe it.* · *The energy is pulling. BUY! now.* · *Come for the business, stay for the fun.* · *MCA! → ∞³.*
- **Use:** Merch (T-shirts, caps), social bios, one-line CTAs, Launch Pad accents, RUMOR HAS IT! copy. Feed into deck §19 (T-shirt slogan) and MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG.

**Surfaces:** README, Launch Pad, checkout, deck-script-writing-content-patterns.md §19, MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG, future merch/catalog.

**Rule:** T-shirt slogan = content category for T-shirt-grade taglines. Capture them explicitly so we can use them everywhere they fit. New category; same content systems.

- **Onramps and grants CTA** appears on README, Launch Pad, ONE_PAGER_ULTIMATE_VIP — with clear line: recipients agree to be customer stories.
