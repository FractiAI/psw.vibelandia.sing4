## QUOTE

**NOT ALL WORDS ARE CREATED EQUAL.**

## REFERS TO BBHE PROGRAMMING

**BBHE programming** = the way we choose and place words in BBHE surfaces. Some words carry more pull, more intoxication, more conversion. Word choice is programming. Not every word has the same weight, the same energy, the same effect. We program with words that matter.

- **Programming:** Scripting, copy, word choice across BBHE surfaces (impulse buy, intoxication, BUY! now, Trust the protocol!, etc.).
- **Not equal:** High-density words vs filler. Crystallized taglines vs generic copy. T-shirt-grade phrases vs forgettable text.
- **Use:** Remind team and vibers that we curate words — we don’t treat all words the same. Merch, script decks, BBHE surfaces, T-shirt slogan category.
