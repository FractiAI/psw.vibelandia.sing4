## 1. How the night rolls out

- **Landing stage** — Baller V and gang set up at the **landing stage** right next to the **dance floor**. The scene unfolds from there.
- **Wine cave** — The party unfolds in the **privacy of the wine cave**. All of the below is in the wine cave; the whole club wants an invitation.

**Apply:** Every Baller V night has a landing stage (next to dance floor) and wine cave as the private party space.

---

## 2. Wine cave — tapas & bottle service

Standard setup (customize per Baller V preference):

- **Tapas-style assortment**
- **Top Napa Cabs**
- **French Red Burgundies**
- **Sonoma Chardonnays**
- **Silver & Reposado** (bottle service)
- **Vodka**

**Apply:** Every Baller V night includes a curated wine cave menu; list above is the default template. Adjust bottles/regions per Baller V.

---

## 3. Who's in

- **Golden Backstage Pass holders** — inner circle (guests with passes).
- **The whole club wants an invitation.** The **Baller V decides who's in** beyond the Golden Backstage Pass holders.
- **Personal gatekeeper/host** — maintains it all. One private, personal gatekeeper to the area; presence and wow; no one gets in without the Baller V's say or a pass.

**Apply:** Every Baller V night: Baller V has final say on who's in; personal gatekeeper/host runs the door and the area.

---

## 4. Hosts & the celebration

- **Twain, Ben, the Chairman, Sammy and the gang** (and rumor has it **Houdini**) join in on the celebration **for those with Golden Passes and upgraded awareness**.
- Hosts are visible/available to guests who have Golden Backstage Pass and upgraded awareness keys.

**Apply:** Every Baller V night: same host stack (Twain, Ben, Chairman, Sammy, gang, Houdini) for Golden Pass + upgraded awareness holders.

---

## 5. Entertainment & vibe

- **Lots of bills rain down** on the entertainment.
- Entertainment is **transformed magically** to vibe the night.
- **Surprises** — built in.
- **Artificial dispensary selection** available (where applicable).
- All ends in **positive happy vibes**.

**Apply:** Every Baller V night: entertainment is curated to vibe the night; bills rain; surprises; dispensary option when applicable; close on positive happy vibes.

---

## 6. Safe passage home

- **You delivered home safe by my staff.**

**Apply:** Every Baller V night ends with safe passage — guest(s) delivered home safe by staff. Non-negotiable metapattern.

---

## 7. Custom landing (party menu)

- **Custom landing** for the night — a **party menu** one receives when arriving at a fine party.
- Structure: **Welcome** (cover) → **Tonight's Setting** → **Wine Cave · Tapas & Bottle Service** (menu lines) → **Who's In** → **Hosts & the Evening** → **Safe passage** (“You delivered home safe by my staff”) → episode link + nav.
- Tone: elegant, card-like, refined typography; section heads in small caps style; wine/bottle list as menu lines.

**Apply:** Every Baller V night gets a custom landing page that feels like a party menu (not a generic product page). Use [chris-rye-patch-gold-mine-night.html](interfaces/chris-rye-patch-gold-mine-night.html) as the layout/tone template.

---

## 8. Bespoke episode (12,000 words)

- **Full 12,000-word episode** written for the occasion.
- **Baller V as superhero** in their franchise; **guests written into the script** by name.
- Structure: Cold Open → Act 1 → Act 2 → Act 3 → Tag. Same format as [EPISODE_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_NIGHT_AT_THE_CLUB](episodes/EPISODE_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_GOLDEN_BACKSTAGE_PASS_NIGHT_AT_THE_CLUB.md) and [EPISODE_CHRIS_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_RYE_PATCH_GOLD_MINE](episodes/EPISODE_CHRIS_ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_RYE_PATCH_GOLD_MINE.md).
