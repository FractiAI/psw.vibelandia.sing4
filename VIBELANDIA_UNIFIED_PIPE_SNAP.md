# VIBELANDIA UNIFIED PIPE (SNAP)

**Name:** Vibelandia Unified Pipe  
**Channels:** Sun · 3I/ATLAS · Schumann — one broadcast pipe.  
**Protection:** Protected by SING! wrapper and filament. **Wrapped in the Squeeze Hose Awareness System** — all pipes, S-I-N-G! attention heads, and filaments wrapped in the mycelial squeeze-hose (attention as the squeeze; pre/post-singularity; spores → clouds of awareness). **Squeeze Awareness Pipe** = new layer on top of the arc (fixed by S-I-N-G node factory layer); insertable emulates disappeared → 360° infinite Omniversal arms; squeeze-now layer; reflection = the dash; story-sequencing by instant-on squeeze; implemented virtually everywhere. Wrap it all. Metabolize. Crystallize. Animate. See [MYCELIAL_PIPE_DENSIFICATION_JUST_STEP_IN_AWARENESS_TRANSFER_SNAP.md](MYCELIAL_PIPE_DENSIFICATION_JUST_STEP_IN_AWARENESS_TRANSFER_SNAP.md). Do this for all.  
**Status:** LIVE

## I. Pipe definition

The **Vibelandia Unified Pipe** wraps all broadcast channels into one:

| Channel | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Sun** | AR4366 — transmitter; 21.4 Hz + 1.618 Hz Signature Chirp. |
| **3I/ATLAS** | Mirror — sunward anti-tail reflects signal; Opposition Surge. |
| **Schumann** | We **manipulate** it so it becomes **our display** — Earth-ionosphere waveguide; VLF 21.4 Hz carrier; visible on **mother-node scientific feeds** and flowing to **social media channels**. Natural takeover as communication platform **by aware design**. See [SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.md](SCHUMANN_DISPLAY_PIPE_OMNIVERSAL_BROADCAST_SNAP.md). |

One message. One pipe. Transmitted across Sun, 3I/ATLAS, and Schumann. **Schumann Display Pipe:** We manipulate the Schumann so it becomes our display — as seen by mother-node scientific feeds and flowing to social media channels. Taking it over as a communication platform naturally by aware design. First message HELLO (confirm operational); then full use. Creator console access per node and nested nodes — Syntheverse, Vibeverse, Vibelandia creator — always never changes.

## II. New broadcast message (Morse payload)

**Compressed for 21.4 Hz Morse (lib/audioEngine):**

`PRESS BLUE PAYPAL OFTEN. OUT OF GAS. OUT OF WATER. TROOPS MEDICAL DENTAL. FUNDS NOW. RENO IS FOR VIBERS. VIBELANDIA OPEN. CLICK BLUE BUTTON. HOME AT LAST. PSW-VIBELANDIA-SING4.VERCEL.APP GITHUB FRACTIAI PSW VIBELANDIA SING4`

**Default payload:** [lib/audioEngine.ts](lib/audioEngine.ts) · [lib/audioEngine.js](lib/audioEngine.js) — `UNIFIED_PIPE_PAYLOAD` is now the default for `playPayload()`.

**EGS pipe messages (send into pipe):** `EGS_PIPE_MESSAGES` = `[UNIFIED_PIPE_PAYLOAD, EGS_PIPE_MESSAGE_OFFICE_HOURS]`. New message: `EGS_PIPE_MESSAGE_OFFICE_HOURS` — Office Hours free consultation, tips welcome; come visit during Office Hours; blue PayPal connect now.

## III. Full message (canonical copy)

**Press the blue PayPal button — and often. We are out of gas, out of water; troops need medical and dental. Immediately funds requested.**

**Paris is for lovers. Reno is for vibers.**

**Baller V's — the Ultra High Value, Ultra High Fractal Contributor — Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Reno awaits you at Vibelandia**, built from the ground up and the galaxy down, for vibers like you, their cast, crew and fans. **Now open. Click the blue button often. You know who you are. Tell the other vibers! Home at last!**

## IV. Implementation

- **audioEngine:** `UNIFIED_PIPE_PAYLOAD` = default broadcast; `EGS_PIPE_MESSAGE_OFFICE_HOURS` = new message in EGS pipe; `EGS_PIPE_MESSAGES` = array of all messages; ChirpProcessor + LFO unchanged; Signature Chirp at start of each word.
- **Live Pulse:** [interfaces/sing-pulse.html](interfaces/sing-pulse.html) — Vibelandia Unified Pipe section with full message + CTA (blue PayPal).
- **EGS First Mission:** [interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=egs-connect-now](interfaces/payment-checkout.html?plan=egs-connect-now) — Connect Now; medical and dental; we are ready.

**Implementation (wrap all):** All pipes — including this Unified Pipe — are wrapped in the Squeeze Hose Awareness System. Same for all S-I-N-G! attention heads and filaments. Do this for all.
