## Canonical rule

**Text-to-track motor:** The **artist creator gives executive instruction to his studio or concert team** (new options: **studio**, **concert**). Input = **songs in text**. Output = **studio-quality production WAV**. Each track (1–12) = one **master musician** (holographic name) and their instrument (e.g. Sera · Bass, Kael · Drums, … Maestro · Producer/Conductor). **Squeeze all to master musicians** under **Hero Rick's exec producer direction**; Hero Rick reports to **Hero Jo**; Hero Jo reports to **Chairman Creator**. Entire engine and experience **SING! nodified** and organized in **NSPFRNP nests**. See [SING_NODIFY_TEXT_TO_STUDIO_SONG_ENGINE_NSPFRNP_NESTS_SNAP.md](SING_NODIFY_TEXT_TO_STUDIO_SONG_ENGINE_NSPFRNP_NESTS_SNAP.md). **Available in 1 to 12 tracks initially.** Motor uses **Seed + Edge + team + executive instruction** only. **Copyright-free**. **Download** (one per track) + **auto-save to playlist** + **auto-save to catalog** as NSPFRNP.
