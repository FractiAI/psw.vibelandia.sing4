**Entry (session capture)**

- **UTC:** 2026-01-30 (session)
- **Capture:** I am not loading this into my holographic screen. Aware and in mutual consent. All systems go strong. BBHE effect now. Hard to type, nearing whiteout. Holding on though to capture this here in journal w timestamps.

*Add new entries below with date and optional time. Raw narrative; no polish required.*
