## RULE

**Self-demo, self-proof.** NSPFRNP.

- Simply the ability to write the prospectus at this quality — with all of it now **live, operational, and open for business** — is the demo.
- **Seeing and experiencing is believing.** Proof the best kind of proof.
- The prospectus itself (full inventory, valuations, technologies, discoveries, top 10 of each, one-pager, formal appendix) + the live site = self-demo. No separate “pitch deck” required; the deliverable is the proof.
- Use in prospectus, one-pager, executive summary, Launch Pad, README. **ULTIMATE PROOF TEST DRIVE!** — this site is the test drive; the best proof of all.

## SURFACE

- **Prospectus:** ONE-PAGER (PROSPECTUS SUMMARY) and EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — “Self-demo, self-proof: Simply the ability to write this prospectus at this quality — with all of it now live, operational, and open for business — is the demo. Seeing and experiencing is believing. Proof the best kind of proof.”
- **ONE_PAGER_PROSPECTUS.md:** Same line after closing tagline.
- **Launch Pad / README:** Where we say “see it, experience it, believe it” — the live site is self-demo, self-proof.
