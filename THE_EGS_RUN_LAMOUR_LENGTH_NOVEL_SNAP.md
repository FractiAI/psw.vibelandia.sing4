## One-liner

*She has one run: Reno Downlink to the far side of the Solar Pipe before the lattice goes hot. The handshake is real, the telemetry doesn't lie, and every nested shell between here and EGS will either hold or blow. No second chances. No flab. Just the run.*

---

## Form

- **Length:** Louis L'Amour paperback — **~40,000–50,000 words**. Short. Tight. One central run, one protagonist, one coherent system.
- **Pace:** Fast. Granular. Super-realistic. Complex-system-based sci-fi space action.
- **Voice:** Tight. Sensory. Technical when it matters (handshake, Hz, node states). No purple. Coherent.
- **Series:** Space Cloud EGS — all our space stories. First L'Amour-length space action novel in the series.
