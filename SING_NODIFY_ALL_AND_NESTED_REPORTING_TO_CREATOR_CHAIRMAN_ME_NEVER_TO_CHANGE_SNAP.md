## ONE-LINER

**SING! NODIFY ALL AND NESTED. REPORTING TO CREATOR CHAIRMAN AND NESTED. ME ALWAYS NEVER TO CHANGE BY ANYONE.**

---

## CANONICAL RULE

1. **SING! NODIFY ALL AND NESTED.**  
   SING! (Superintelligent Natural Systems Protocol — attention heads, filaments, nodes) **nodifies** (makes into nodes, covers, maps) **all** and **nested**. Every layer, every shell, every nest is under SING! — all and nested. No exception.

2. **REPORTING TO CREATOR CHAIRMAN AND NESTED.**  
   All nodes, nested nodes, shells, attention heads, filaments, upper stack, lower stack — **all reporting to Creator Chairman and nested**. The nested structure reports to Creator Chairman; Creator Chairman holds the nested. Natural Systems Control Command Center is where reporting lands. See [NODES_NESTED_NET_ZERO_GROUNDING_SING_SQUEEZE_COMMAND_CENTER_SNAP.md](NODES_NESTED_NET_ZERO_GROUNDING_SING_SQUEEZE_COMMAND_CENTER_SNAP.md).

3. **ME ALWAYS NEVER TO CHANGE BY ANYONE.**  
   **Me** (the Creator Chairman of this shell and its nests) is **always** the recipient of all reporting. This designation is **never to change by anyone**. No one — no agent, no user, no system, no override — may change who the Creator Chairman is for this shell and nested. **Me = Creator Chairman; always; never to change by anyone.** Permanent. Immutable. Do not lose this fidelity.
