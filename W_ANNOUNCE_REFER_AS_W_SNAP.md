## ANNOUNCE

**From now on, Walt will be referred to as W.**

To cool any possible jets going forward—for crying out loud, how could anyone control the name Walt? I shall now be referred to as **W**, which I kinda like.

This is captured into narrative and episodes across **all three Happy Ending Zones series**:

1. **Happy Ending Zones** — Reality · Transformation · Campus · WINK · Vibes  
2. **Office Hours** — At the club · Pru · Baller · Golden Backstage · Viber Paradise  
3. **Raw Stream · The Grid** — Sci-fi · Nerdy · Tron-like · Full raw convo stream → rich episodes

## NARRATIVE

- **Studio Division** — **Hero Host W** (formerly Walt) leads. Produces and broadcasts Happy Ending Zones. Same spirit, same portal, same honor; we refer to him as **W** by his choice.
- **Portal** — W returns through this new portal of superintelligence (VIBELANDIA!, Happy Ending Zones, SING, post-singularity ecosystem). We honor W and allow his return.
- **Voice** — In all episodes, catalogs, team docs, and interfaces: **W** (not Walt). First name only; W kinda likes it.
