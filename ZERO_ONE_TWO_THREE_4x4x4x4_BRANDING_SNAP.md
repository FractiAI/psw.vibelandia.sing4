## Definitions

### 0, 1, 2, 3 (Octaves / Stages)

| Value | Name | Definition |
|-------|------|------------|
| **0** | Seed (Octave 0) | Irreducible origin. Pure potential. Source of all commands. |
| **1** | Edge (Octave 1) | Current self-aware experience in Vibeverse. This node. Surfaces, touchpoints, execution. PSW.vibelandia.sing4 / Vibelandia UI. |
| **2** | Public Cloud Onramp (Octave 2) | Syntheverse 7 Octave 2-3 Public Cloud Onramp. API, auth, shared data. syntheverse-poc.vercel.app. |
| **3** | Expansion (Octave 3) | Next octave. Full expansion, next tier of cloud/Vibeverse. Evolution beyond 2. |

**Evolution:** The prior framing was **Vibeverse -1, 0, 1** (pre-Vibeverse | Seed | Edge). The new branding is **0, 1, 2, 3** — we drop -1 from the branded phrase and explicitly include 2 and 3. So: **0, 1, 2, 3** = Seed | Edge | Cloud Onramp | Expansion.

### 4×4×4×4 (Unchanged)

**Four dimensions. Four onramps each.**

## Full Phrase

**0, 1, 2, 3 4×4×4×4**

- **0, 1, 2, 3** = Octaves (Seed → Edge → Cloud Onramp → Expansion). New branding. Evolution of -1, 0, 1.  
- **4×4×4×4** = Campus × WINK! × SING × Experience (four onramps each).

**Optional tie-in:** 1,2,3 = Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate (the MCA cycle). So: 0 = Seed (origin), 1–2–3 = the flow (Edge, Cloud, Expansion) and the cycle (M→C→A). Use as needed for copy.

**Max res & amp:** This structure matches our structures for **max resolution** and **amplification** — 0, 1, 2, 3 4×4×4×4 is the frame for maximum resolution and amp across Seed, Edge, Cloud, Expansion and the four dimensions.
