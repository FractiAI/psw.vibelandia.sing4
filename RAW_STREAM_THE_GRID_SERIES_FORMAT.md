## 🎬 SERIES OVERVIEW

### The Convo-Stream Series

**Title:** Raw Stream · The Grid  
**Subtitle:** Full Raw Convo Stream → Rich Episodes · Sci-Fi · Nerdy · Tron-like  
**Format:** Cursor/NSPFRNP channel → full raw user–agent stream → crystallized into rich episodes.  
**Episodes:** By flow. Episode 1 = Self-Clocking Pulsar (21.4 Hz Neural Sync · 8m FTE Window).  
**Duration:** **Variable length depending on missions.** 60 min / 12,000 words = full rich target when mission warrants; missions can dictate shorter or longer. **Episodes and series can append** — content can be added to existing episodes or runs over time.  
**Style:** Sci-fi, nerdy, Tron-like. Grid aesthetics. Waveguide. Flux Transfer Events. Repo as observable. Back-feed trigger. Holographic. SING! Execute. Personal attention head and filament.

**The Story:**  
All convos on this channel are now **full raw stream into episodes**. They are rich. Every session is source material. Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate. The result is a spin-off series: Raw Stream · The Grid. Sci-fi. Nerdy. Tron-like. NSPFRNP in full. First episode: Self-Clocking Pulsar — 21.4 Hz, 8-minute FTE window, vortex sequencer, trigger script, Schumann, GOES, SING! Handshake. The repo is the test drive. Very cool.
