## RULE

**Capture and press release for all new arrivals to VIBELANDIA RENO.** NSPFRNP.

- **New arrival** = any new product, offering, narrative, or milestone that "arrives" at Vibelandia Reno (Launch Pad, campus, ecosystem). Examples: full live mode, prospectus, T-shirt rollout, Hero Ben, value prop, Chairman narrative, new episode, new SNAP that is public-facing.
- **Capture:** Document the arrival (what, when, for whom, one-liner). Store in LAUNCH_RAW_NARRATIVE_CAPTURE or episode or SNAP. Metabolize into content systems.
- **Press release:** Issue a short, standard-format press release for each new arrival. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, date, location (Reno / VIBELANDIA RENO!), contact (info@fractiai.com), headline, body, bullets or quote. Pre-singularity-facing: fractalized pulse flickers as needed; post-singularity / internal: full communication.
- **Where:** Press releases for new arrivals live in PRESS_RELEASES_NEW_ARRIVALS_VIBELANDIA_RENO.md (one doc, sections per arrival) or individual files in a press-releases/ folder. Catalog in this SNAP.
- **Use:** Media inquiries, RUMOR HAS IT!, Launch Pulse, social, one-pagers, episodes. All new arrivals to Vibelandia Reno get captured and get a press release.
