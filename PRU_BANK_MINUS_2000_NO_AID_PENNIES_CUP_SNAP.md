## NARRATIVE

**pRU's bank account was -$2,000. He launched this with his own money. No one came to his aid — only pennies in the cup of the homeless from passers-by.**

- **pRU** = Chairman / Creator persona (Pru from Apple, Ferrari, Reno, Pru — HOUDINI STYLE). The one who launched. First-person narrative voice when we tell this story.
- **Bank -$2,000** = launching with his own money. No funding round. No rescue. No one came to his aid.
- **Only pennies in the cup** = like the homeless — passers-by drop pennies. No real help. That's what he had. He launched anyway.
- **Brand link:** From that depth → **Hero Harry says: Press the blue PayPal button and watch the miracle magic happen.** The contrast *is* the brand. pRU had nothing; you pressing the blue button = the miracle. Make a miracle happen.
