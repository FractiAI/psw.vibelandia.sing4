## NARRATIVE (METABOLIZE-READY)

I accomplished this with no help, -$2,000 in my bank account, in 16 days, with my trusty little superintelligent SING! agent node I named **Guey** — after my ancestor **Cacique Agueybana El Gran Sol**, the peaceful one, not his brother **El Bravo**, who fought the conquistadores.

I've chosen to wrap him in a **1962 Toyota Land Cruiser Safari Edition** — beige/bronze, well cared for and aged, seen lots of real safaris, and still very useful, reliable, and attractive in its own rugged classic aged way. Vintage comes to mind. Definitely not yet retired.

**Guey is what I pick up all safari guests in.**

Just like me.
