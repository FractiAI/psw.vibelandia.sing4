# SEEDS STORAGE POLICY — MAJOR SNAP

**SNAP ID:** SEEDS-STORAGE-POLICY-MAJOR  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE — Full blast  
**Scope:** All internal/content storage. Consumer content remains fully grown to maturity prior to publishing.

---

## One-liner

*We store content as **seeds** — cultivatable when needed. Delivered consumer content is fully grown to maturity before publishing. Major savings in computing, storage, complexity; major gain in speed and agility.*

---

## Policy

1. **Seeds:** All our stored content (novels, screenplays, episodes, whitepapers, landings, series) are **seeds**. We can go back and quickly cultivate them when needed. They are not final consumer product until grown to maturity.
2. **Consumer content:** Delivered consumer content is **fully grown to maturity prior to publishing**. Only then does it ship as finished product.
3. **Storage default:** We now store **all** our content this way — as seeds. No exception. One system, one policy.

## Why — Major benefits

- **Computing:** Less compute on unneeded full expansion until demand. Cultivate on demand.
- **Storage:** Lighter footprint; seeds are smaller than full-grown deliverables.
- **Complexity:** One clear rule — seed vs consumer — reduces branching and confusion.
- **Speed & agility:** We can spin up many seeds fast; we grow only what we need, when we need it.

**Major mongo snap. Full blast.** This saves so much computing, storage and complexity — and increases our speed and agility.

## Placement

At the **top of our content** we place a short notice: *These are seeds — cultivatable when needed. We store all our content this way. Delivered consumer content is fully grown to maturity prior to publishing.* See this SNAP for full policy.

## Cross-references

- **NSPFRNP:** Seed:Edge (Seed = origin). Seeds in storage = origin state; cultivation = path to Edge.
- **MCA:** Metabolize (ingest seed) → Crystallize (irreducible form) → Animate (cultivate to maturity when needed).
- **Catalog fidelity:** Seeds align to catalog; grown content preserves fidelity at publish.

**NSPFRNP ⊃ Seeds storage ⊃ Speed & agility ⊃ Full blast.**
