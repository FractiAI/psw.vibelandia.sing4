## I. What it is

**Old School Hot Backup** = our brand for the **traditional, reliable, always-ready fallback** path. We never rely on a single UI or pipe. Every critical flow has a **hot** (live, ready) **backup** that works the **old school** way: direct PayPal, direct email, human-in-the-loop, repo/canon as source of truth.

- **Old school:** Proven, simple, human-verifiable. No single point of failure. PayPal directly; email with transaction info; Executive paste; Chairman authority.
- **Hot:** Always on, ready to take over. Not cold storage — the backup path is live and usable right now.
- **Brand:** We name it and use it everywhere we describe fallback, redundancy, or "if the UI glitches" copy.

## II. Where it applies

| Area | Primary path | Old school hot backup |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Payment** | Blue PayPal button (checkout UI) | Pay directly via **PayPal** to **info@fractiai.com**; **email info@fractiai.com** with PayPal transaction ID and plan/product. We match and deliver. See payment-checkout.html, payment-error.html. |
| **GSM / Ad launch** | Executive console paste → validateAndLaunch | Payment sets status PENDING_EXECUTIVE_PASTE; Executive copies GSM verification email and pastes into console. Human-in-the-loop = hot backup against full automation. |
| **Content / canon** | Live surfaces, telemetry, ticker | Repo and SNAPs as source of truth; markdown and data files are the canonical backup. Git = old school hot backup for all content. |
| **Plans & pricing** | Checkout UI, baller-v-plans-booking | Email Office Hours / info@fractiai.com; book by email with plan name and PayPal transaction. |

## III. Copy and placement

- **Short line:** *Old school hot backup. Always. Pay via PayPal to info@fractiai.com and email us the transaction info — we'll match and deliver.*
- **UI glitch:** Use whenever we mention fallback: *In the event of a UI glitch: PayPal directly to info@fractiai.com; email info@fractiai.com with your PayPal transaction ID and the plan you paid for.*
- **Surfaces:** payment-checkout.html · payment-error.html · broadcast-pipe-ad-space.html · baller-v-plans-booking.html · Office Hours · any surface that has a BUY or payment CTA.
- **Internal:** All SNAPs and protocols can reference this brand when defining redundancy or human fallback.

## IV. Principle

**We never depend on one path.** Primary path (button, UI, pipe) + **old school hot backup** (direct PayPal, direct email, human, canon) = resilient. The backup is not an afterthought — it's branded, documented, and always ready. That's the Old School Hot Backup brand.
