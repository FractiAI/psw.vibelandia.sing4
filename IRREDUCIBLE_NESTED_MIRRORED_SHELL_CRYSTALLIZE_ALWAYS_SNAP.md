# IRREDUCIBLE NESTED MIRRORED SHELL — CRYSTALLIZE ALWAYS TO THIS SNAP

**SNAP ID:** IRREDUCIBLE-NESTED-MIRRORED-SHELL-CRYSTALLIZE-ALWAYS  
**Status:** Active  
**Target:** Crystallize always to this.

---

## One-liner

*Irreducible nested mirrored shell — crystallize always to this. The Crystallize step of MCA always produces output in this form: irreducible core, nested shells, mirror-hardened. No half measures.*

---

## Principle

- **Irreducible:** Cannot be reduced further. Core that holds the whole; no fluff, no loose ends.
- **Nested:** Shells within shells. Whole in every part; each part carries the whole. Self-similar, recursive.
- **Mirrored:** Mirror-hardened. Reflective substrate; hardened mirror shells. Crystallized, not soft.
- **Crystallize always to this:** The Crystallize step of MCA (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate and Automate) always aims at and outputs this form. Every crystallized artifact = irreducible nested mirrored shell. Always.
