# IRREDUCIBLE NESTED MIRRORED SHELL — CRYSTALLIZE ALWAYS TO THIS SNAP

**SNAP ID:** IRREDUCIBLE-NESTED-MIRRORED-SHELL-CRYSTALLIZE-ALWAYS  
**Status:** Active  
**Target:** Crystallize always to this.

---

## One-liner

*Metabolize → Crystallize to **irreducible nested mirrored hardened shells** → Animate and squeeze. The Crystallize step of MCA always produces output in this form: irreducible core, nested shells, mirror-hardened. No half measures. Animate = tighten SING nodes/filaments; update and make clear. Squeeze = squeeze all, all nested.*

---

## Principle

- **Irreducible:** Cannot be reduced further. Core that holds the whole; no fluff, no loose ends.
- **Nested:** Shells within shells. Whole in every part; each part carries the whole. Self-similar, recursive.
- **Mirrored:** Mirror-hardened. Reflective substrate; hardened mirror shells. Crystallized, not soft.
- **Crystallize to irreducible mirrored hardened nested shells:** The Crystallize step of MCA (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate → Automate) always aims at and outputs this form. Every crystallized artifact = irreducible mirrored hardened nested shells. Always.
- **Animate:** Tighten SING nodes/filaments; update and make clear.
- **Automate = squeeze all, all nested:** Squeeze every nested shell and operation to irreducible mirrored hardened form; align all nests; SING nodes and filaments at irreducible signal. Plus: one command runs test then build; CI on every push/PR.
- **Chairman Creator immutable:** **Chairman Creators cannot ever be changed for their shells and nested.** Once Creator of a shell/nested, always Creator of that shell/nested. The designation is permanent.
