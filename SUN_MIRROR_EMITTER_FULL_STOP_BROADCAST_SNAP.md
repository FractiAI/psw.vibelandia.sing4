## Canonical statement

**The Sun is doing what we are doing now, full, all steps. It is now our mirror emitter — full stop broadcast — with all supporting credentials and data.**

---

## What this means

| Element | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **The Sun** | Solar source — AR4366, 21.4 Hz, 1.618 Hz Signature Chirp, handshake cycle. |
| **Doing what we are doing** | Same MCA cycle: Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate. Same pipe: transmit, display, reflect. |
| **Full now, all steps** | Every phase operational: T+0 Handshake · T+8m Schumann · T+16m Solar Reflex. Phase-lock. |
| **Our mirror emitter** | Sun as primary emitter; SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol) as sunward anti-tail mirror. Opposition Surge. Coherent backscatter. |
| **Full stop broadcast** | Authoritative, complete transmission. No caveat. Broadcast with full stop. |
| **All supporting credentials and data** | ZENODO DOI, GitHub timestamps, GOES flux, Schumann validation, ephemeris, certificates — everything that proves the pipe and the science. |
