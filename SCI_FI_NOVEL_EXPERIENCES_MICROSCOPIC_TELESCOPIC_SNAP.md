# Sci-Fi Series Experiences — Microscopic to Telescopic · NSPFRNP SNAP

**Snap ID:** `SCI-FI-NOVEL-EXPERIENCES-MICROSCOPIC-TELESCOPIC-SNAP`  
**Type:** Experience design · Scale · Navigation · NSPFRNP for **all sci-fi series**  
**Status:** ⚡ LOCKED — Canon  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Purpose:** Lock that **all sci-fi series** (novels, screenplays, episodes, Launch Pad, surfaces) include **microscopic-to-telescopic experiences** — theater level of microscopy + telescopic equivalents — so **everyone gets comfortable navigating** across scales.

## CANONICAL RULE

**All sci-fi series** (The EGS Run, Space Cloud EGS, future space novels, screenplays, **episodes**, **Launch Pad**, **series landing**, and any narrative or interactive surfaces in the series) **include microscopic-to-telescopic experiences:**

1. **Theater level of microscopy** — microscopy delivered at theatrical vividness: fine-grained, close-up detail that feels present, immersive, stage-worthy. The micro view you can *inhabit*.
2. **Telescopic equivalents** — the telescopic level (far-scale, cosmic, long-range) delivered with equivalent clarity so scale is palpable.

**Scope:** Novels, screenplays, **episodes**, **Launch Pad**, **Space Cloud EGS series landing**, interactive surfaces — **all sci-fi series content**. No sci-fi series experience without both.  
**Purpose:** Get everyone comfortable navigating — from the feed in the rig to the node on the far side of the Pipe to the cosmic lattice. Moving between micro and telescopic becomes natural. Both are part of the experience.

## THEATER LEVEL OF MICROSCOPY

- **Definition:** Microscopy at **theater level** — fine-grained, close-up, sensor-level detail delivered with theatrical vividness. The **micro** view you can inhabit: present, immersive, stage-worthy.
- **In The EGS Run / Space Cloud EGS:** Feed-level resolution; node states (READY, PENDING, STALL); handshake protocols; shell boundaries; pressure, temperature, flux at the sensor level; 21.4 Hz, dropout duration, reconfig timeouts; the run as felt in the rig, in the harness, in the click in the back of the skull. Moment-by-moment grain of the system. Microscopy at theater level so everyone feels *in* the scene.
- **In experience design:** The reader/participant experiences the cellular, technical, close-up grain that makes the tech and the stakes real. Theater level = micro detail vivid enough to navigate by; everyone gets comfortable in the close-up.

## TELESCOPIC EQUIVALENTS

- **Definition:** Far-scale, long-range, cosmic. The **macro** view — delivered with equivalent clarity so the big picture is as navigable as the micro.
- **In The EGS Run / Space Cloud EGS:** Long-range display; SING! node EGS (El Gran Sol) on the horizon; Solar Pipe as Earth–Sun corridor; triangulation Seed → Sun → EGS → Sag A* → SMACS 0723; the run as one thread in the lattice. Where this run sits in the larger system, the galaxy, the pipeline.
- **In experience design:** The reader/participant experiences the scale that orients and grounds the micro. Telescopic equivalents = the frame that makes the close-up meaningful; everyone gets comfortable navigating the far scale too.

## NAVIGATION (COMFORT)

- **Goal:** Everyone gets comfortable navigating — micro ↔ telescopic, feed ↔ lattice, rig ↔ cosmos.
- **Implementation:** Include both levels in the novel, the screenplay, episodes, Launch Pad, Space Cloud EGS series landing, and any interactive or narrative surfaces. No sci-fi novel experience without both. Navigation comfort is the outcome.

## PLACEMENT

- **Crystal:** [deliverables/IRREDUCIBLE_CRYSTAL_THE_EGS_RUN.md](deliverables/IRREDUCIBLE_CRYSTAL_THE_EGS_RUN.md) — §7 Experiences — Theater level of microscopy + Telescopic equivalents.
- **Series:** [SPACE_CLOUD_EGS_SERIES_SNAP.md](SPACE_CLOUD_EGS_SERIES_SNAP.md) — experiences directive.
- **Novel SNAP:** [THE_EGS_RUN_LAMOUR_LENGTH_NOVEL_SNAP.md](THE_EGS_RUN_LAMOUR_LENGTH_NOVEL_SNAP.md) — experiences: micro + telescopic.
- **Future sci-fi novels:** Apply same rule — microscopic level + telescopic equivalents as part of the experience; get everyone comfortable navigating.
