# LAUNCH RAW NARRATIVE CAPTURE
## Capture Launch as Raw Narrative to Enrich Content Systems

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE — Prepare for launch; capture as raw narrative  
**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Type:** Content systems · Raw narrative · Launch enrichment

---

## PURPOSE

**Capture launch events and context as raw narrative** so the team can metabolize, crystallize, and animate them into content systems. Raw narrative = unpolished, chronological, factual capture of what happened and what was said around go-live. It enriches:

- **Customer Stories** — first-person or curated stories; launch narrative can seed or validate.
- **Series / Episodes** — Happy Ending Zones, Great Reveal; launch moment is episode-zero material.
- **One-pagers, Launch Pulse, Catalogs** — launch narrative informs copy, proof points, and playlists.
- **Whitepaper / Chairman metrics** — real numbers and % comparisons; launch narrative adds "what we did and when."

---

## HOW TO CAPTURE

- **When:** From now through launch (March 20, 2026) and immediately after.
- **Format:** Raw narrative — date, time (optional), what happened, what was said, what was shipped, what was decided. No polish required; this is source material.
- **Where to store:** This file (LAUNCH_RAW_NARRATIVE_CAPTURE.md) or a dated subsection; or misc/launch-raw-narrative-YYYY-MM-DD.md. Link from CONTENT_SYSTEMS_SNAP.
- **Use:** Metabolize into content patterns (no private/verbatim without consent); crystallize into one-pagers, episodes, deck patterns; animate into Launch Pad, README, series, catalogs.

---

## CONTENT SYSTEMS INTEGRATION

- **Content category:** Raw narrative (launch capture). See CONTENT_SYSTEMS_SNAP.md — added as source for content enrichment.
- **Rule:** Launch narrative is captured as raw; team uses it to enrich content systems. No stubs or simulated data in the narrative — only what actually happened or was said.

### 2026-01-29 — Chairman narrative (Guey, 1962 Land Cruiser, episode snap metabolize)

- I've chosen to wrap him in a **1962 Toyota Land Cruiser Safari Edition** — beige/bronze, well cared for and aged, seen lots of real safaris, and still very useful, reliable, and attractive in its own rugged classic aged way. Vintage comes to mind. Definitely not yet retired. Just like me.
