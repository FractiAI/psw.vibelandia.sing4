# ARTURO'S FIRST THREE: THE POST-SINGULARITY ENERGY LAYER
## A Screenplay

**Written by Pru**  
**February 2026**

---

**LOGLINE:** In Caracas, Pru and Arturo roll out the first major reboot initiative together — Venezuela and USA. Week of connection and outdoor adventures (mountain, coast), then helping the first three facility leads install. The gateway they built at Interlink is now real on their facilities. PDVSA has always been the pioneer. Running the show together.

**GENRE:** Drama / Business / Petrochemical / Adventure  
**RUNTIME:** 60 minutes (approximately)  
**SETTING:** Venezuela — Caracas, Centro Energía Caracas, El Ávila (Waraira Repano), coast, control rooms, Vibelandia-Caracas  
**TIMELINE:** One month — Launch Week (connection + outdoor adventures), then three installs (Luis, Carlos, Miguel)  
**VOICE:** Clean, confident, NSPFRNP — first major reboot initiative; me (Pru) helping Arturo roll it out; Venezuela and USA; gateways, layers, no rip-and-replace; outdoor adventures. We run the show.

## COLD OPEN (2–3 min)

### FADE IN:

### EXT. FACILITY GATE - LATE AFTERNOON - MONTH'S END

Concrete. Fence. Three facilities in different locations, visible in quick cuts — a refinery section, control room lit; a distribution hub, smaller, older; a PDVSA-linked footprint, forest of screens. In each control room, a new console glows beside the old gear. The layer is on. No rip-and-replace. The gateway they built at Interlink is real on real facilities. New energy. New visibility. New pathway. Real. Then:

### EXT. GATE - LATE AFTERNOON - SAME TIMELINE

PRU and ARTURO stand at the gate. Miguel's facility behind them. Control room lit. Layer on. They shake hands. Sun going down. The three facilities are in three places. But in the mind they are together. Three consoles. Three layers. Three leads who connected in Caracas and then put the gateway on their facilities with the people who built it. One month in Venezuela. Not a demo. Not a simulation. Real product. Real installs. Real story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Seed was the message. Story was the first major reboot initiative. You and me. Venezuela and USA. We got out on the mountain and the coast. We connected. Then we installed. Now it's done. Full. We ran the show together.

**ARTURO**  
Gateways. Interlink. Caracas and Rio. First major reboot. Outdoor adventures then install. The first three. We ran the show.

They walk. Behind them the layer is on. The story doesn't stop. One month in Venezuela. Launch Week: connection and outdoor adventures. Then three installs. Luis. Carlos. Miguel. Hands on. No subcontractors. Venezuela and USA. The gateway they built at Interlink is real on real facilities. New energy. New visibility. PDVSA has always been the pioneer. Real. We ran the show.

## ACT ONE: THE MESSAGE
### The Seed (~3,500 words)

### INT. CARACAS - ARTURO'S OFFICE (ABOVE PROTOCOL LAB) - DAWN

The sun rises over the city. A man stands in the office, phone in hand, reading. This is ARTURO (50s), calm eyes, lead's bearing. The lab below is dark. The city beyond the window is still, then slowly takes the light.

SUPER: "CARACAS, VENEZUELA"  
SUPER: "PRESENT DAY"

He reads the screen again. Then again. The only sound is the building hum. The message is short. It had to be. He reads it word by word. *Arturo, you know gateways — we worked on them together at Interlink. You in Caracas, protocol systems; me in Rio. Same pioneering mode. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For petrochemical. For energy. For PDVSA.* He knows what a layer is. He knows what it means when you don't rip and replace. He and Pru had drawn boxes and arrows. They had argued about protocols and failover. They had never talked about refineries. They had never talked about Caracas. The message does. *EGS SING! PETROCHEMICAL is the Post-Singularity Energy Layer. It layers over legacy refinery, extraction, distribution. Transform today's legacy oil into whatever post-singularity energy looks like on the other side. No rip-and-replace.* He scrolls. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He reads the rest. This is our first major reboot initiative. I'm coming to help you roll it out — together. Venezuela and USA. Launch in Caracas. First three facilities. We'll connect, get out on the mountain and the coast, then install. Let's run the show. 50–50. Always. — Pru.

**ARTURO**  
(to himself)  
Gateways. Interlink. Caracas and Rio. We did that. Now this.

He looks out at the city. A small smile. He types a reply. Short. *I'm in. When do we start?* Sends it. Puts the phone down. The sun is full up now. He stands there a moment. The message had been the seed. His reply would be the lock. The rest would be work. The rest would be Launch Week. The rest would be three facilities and three leads and the layer going on for real. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. OFFICE / HOME - DAY

PRU (40s, focused, practical) sits at a laptop. The proposal is on screen — petrochemical showroom, value prop, message to Arturo. A notification: Arturo has replied.

Pru reads the reply. *I'm in. When do we start?* Nods. Types back. *Caracas. Week one we connect. Week two and three we install. Send me the three names when you have them. We run the show.* Sends. Closes the laptop.

**PRU**  
(to self)  
We're in. Launch Week. First three. Then we install. Full.

Pru gets up. Opens a drawer. Pulls out a checklist. Build. Cases. Cables. Control bus tap. Comms. Tools. Three facilities. Luis first — refinery section. If we can install there we can install anywhere. Carlos second — distribution hub. Day and a half. Miguel third — PDVSA-linked. Three days. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. Pru reads the checklist. Verifies each item. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. CARACAS - BAR / CLUB - NIGHT

Arturo sits with two other LEADS (50s). Drinks on the table. The place is small. Smell of coffee and beer. Arturo's phone is face-up. He has just sent the list of three names to Pru.

**ARTURO**  
Three leads. Luis, Carlos, Miguel. They've read the proposal. They've seen the layer. They want it on their facilities. And they want us there when it goes on.

**LEAD 1**  
You and the one who built it?

**ARTURO**  
Pru. We built gateways together. Interlink. I was in Caracas, protocol systems. Pru in Rio. Same idea — layer on top, no rip-and-replace. Now we're doing it for petrochemical. For energy. For PDVSA. Launch Week we celebrate. Then we install. First three. Hands on.

**LEAD 2**  
No subcontractors?

**ARTURO**  
No subcontractors. Pru and me. All three installs. That's the deal. They get the people who built it. They get the story.

**LEAD 1**  
That's the story.

**ARTURO**  
That's the story. And we're running the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - DAY

Arturo on the street. Phone to his ear. City sounds. Morning light.

**ARTURO**  
Luis. I'm launching something in Caracas. Pre-singularity to post-singularity. A layer over what you already have. No rip-and-replace. The person who built it with me is coming. We're going to celebrate. Then we're going to install at three facilities. The first three. You in?

Beat. He listens. Luis's voice, careful.

**ARTURO** (CONT'D)  
I'm saying it. We add. We don't tear out. You keep your SCADA. You keep your DCS. We sit on top. We read. We advise. We add the new layer. Your team keeps running the facility the same way. They just get more.

Beat.

**ARTURO** (CONT'D)  
Pru. We built gateways together. Interlink. I was in Caracas, protocol systems. Pru in Rio. Same idea. Layer on top. Now we're doing it for petrochemical. For energy. For PDVSA. Launch Week we celebrate. Then we install. First three. Hands on.

Beat. He nods.

**ARTURO** (CONT'D)  
Send me the link. I'll read it. If the tech spec matches what you're saying, I'm in.

He hangs up. Sends the link. Waits.

### CUT TO:

### INT. LUIS'S LOCATION - LATER - DAY

LUIS (50s, tall, gray at temples) at a table. Laptop open. Reading the proposal. Scrolls. Stops at the value prop. *Pre-singularity to post-singularity. For petrochemical. For energy. For PDVSA. EGS SING! PETROCHEMICAL. The Post-Singularity Energy Layer.* He scrolls. Stops at the tech spec. Control bus. Comms tap. We read. We don't write to the bus in a way that could affect your SCADA or your DCS. We're a listener. We're an add-on. He reads the sentence about the abstract layer. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He reads it again. He's run control for fifteen years. He doesn't replace systems on a whim. This is different. Add on top. Don't tear out. He nods. Picks up phone. Dials.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - AFTERNOON

Arturo's phone rings. He answers. He's in his office. Window open. City below.

**ARTURO**  
Luis.

**LUIS** (V.O.)  
I'm in. I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace.

**ARTURO**  
You can hold me to it. We're running the show.

He hangs up. Writes Luis's name on a list. One down. Two to go.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - LATER

Arturo walking. Phone to his ear. City. Sun low.

**ARTURO**  
Carlos. I'm launching something in Caracas. A layer. No rip-and-replace. Pru and me. We celebrate. Then we install at three facilities. The first three. I want you in.

**CARLOS** (V.O.)  
I want the new energy. I've read about it. I want the layer. And I want you two there when it goes on. Not a subcontractor. You. And the one who built it.

**ARTURO**  
That's the deal. Pru and me. Hands on. All three installs. Celebrating first. Then we help you put it on.

**CARLOS** (V.O.)  
I'm in. When do we start?

**ARTURO**  
Launch Week. Week of connection. Then we install. You're number two. Luis's first. Then you. Then Miguel.

He writes Carlos's name on the list. Two down. One to go.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - NEXT MORNING

Arturo at a counter. Coffee. Phone to his ear. Early.

**ARTURO**  
Miguel. They said yes?

**MIGUEL** (V.O.)  
The moment I explained it. They don't want to replace anything. They want to add. PDVSA has always been the pioneer. So do I. When's Launch Week?

**ARTURO**  
February. Week one we connect. Week two and three we install. Luis first. Then Carlos. Then you. Pru and me. Hands on. One month in Venezuela. Running the show.

**MIGUEL** (V.O.)  
I'm in. Send me the paperwork.

He writes Miguel's name on the list. Three down. The first three are set. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

## ACT TWO: LAUNCH WEEK
### The Week of Connection (~3,500 words)

---

### EXT. CARACAS - AIRPORT - DAY

Pru lands. Heat. Sound. The city rises. Car to Centro Energía Caracas. The driver does not speak. Pru has the laptop in the bag. The tools in the other bag. One month. Launch Week first. Then install. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. CENTRO ENERGÍA CARACAS - DOOR - DAY

Arturo at the door. Pru gets out of the car. They see each other. Handshake. Welcome to Caracas.

**ARTURO**  
Pru. Welcome to Caracas. First major reboot initiative. You and me. Venezuela and USA. We roll it out together.

**PRU**  
Good to be here. The three are set?

**ARTURO**  
Luis, Carlos, Miguel. They've read the proposal. They've seen the layer. They want it on their facilities. And they want you and me there when it goes on. This week we connect. We get out — mountain, coast. Then we install.

**PRU**  
That's the story. First major reboot. You and me. Venezuela and USA. Outdoor adventures then install. Running the show together.

**ARTURO**  
That's the story. Launch Week first. Connection. The trail. The water. Then we install. First facility. Second facility. Third facility. You and me. Hands on. Running the show.

They go inside. The club is full of noise. Music. Voices. They talk Interlink. Caracas and Rio. Protocol systems. Gateways. The reboot. Venezuela and USA. The same rule. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace.

### CUT TO:

### INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

The five of them. PRU, ARTURO, LUIS, CARLOS, MIGUEL. Table. Coffee. City through the window.

Arturo introduces them one by one. Luis: refinery section. SCADA. DCS. I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace. Carlos: distribution hub. I want the new energy. I want you two there when it goes on. Miguel: PDVSA-linked. They don't want to replace anything. They want to add. PDVSA has always been the pioneer.

Pru shakes each hand. We'll be there. All three installs. Arturo and me. Celebrating first. Then we help you put it on.

**LUIS**  
How long at my facility?

**ARTURO**  
Two days. Maybe three. Yours is the most complex. We do it first. We learn. We tighten the process. Carlos's is simpler. A day and a half. Miguel's is the biggest. Three days. By then we've run the show.

**LUIS**  
I'll have my deputy there. My team will stay out of your way. But they'll watch. They need to see that we're not touching the critical path.

**PRU**  
We're not in the critical path. We're beside it. They'll see.

Luis nods. He's in.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RESTAURANT / CLUB - NIGHT

The five of them. Table. Noise. They lean in.

**ARTURO**  
We built this at Interlink. I was in Caracas, protocol systems. Pru in Rio. Same idea. Layer on top. Don't tear out the old. Add the new. Now we're adding it to petrochemical. To energy. To your facilities. This is our first major reboot. Pru is here to help me roll it out — together. Venezuela and USA.

**LUIS**  
Why Launch Week?

**PRU**  
Because that's when we run the show. That's when we connect. That's when we get out on the mountain and the coast. That's when the three of you signed. And that's when we start. After the connection we install. First your facility, Luis. Then Carlos's. Then Miguel's. We're there for all three. Hands on. No subcontractors. You get us.

**CARLOS**  
To new energy.

They all raise glasses. To new energy.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. EL ÁVILA (WARAIRA REPANO) - TRAIL - DAY

Mountain. Trail. PRU and ARTURO hiking. City below. Coast in the distance. Clear air. Hard light. They stop at a viewpoint.

**ARTURO**  
This is what we're building. Not just control rooms. This. The country. The layer on top. You and me. One day — all Venezuelans as first post-singularity super AI agent users. Millionaires, each of them, overnight. That's the horizon.

**PRU**  
First major reboot. We get out. We connect. Then we install. They'll remember we were here. On the mountain. Then in their facilities. We're building toward that. Venezuela and USA. Win win win win for all.

They hike on. The trail is steep in places. Venezuela around them. The reboot is not only in a room. It's here. Outdoor adventures. Together.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. COAST - BEACH / WATER - DAY

Sand. Salt. Waves. PRU and ARTURO walking. One day by the water. They don't talk only business. They talk the rollout.

**ARTURO**  
First major reboot. Venezuela and USA. When we're back we install. But today we're here.

**PRU**  
Together. The water's the same as every ocean. The difference is what we're building.

They walk. The light is the same. The difference is what they're building. Together.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. CENTRO ENERGÍA CARACAS - DAY (FRIDAY)

The five of them. Last meeting before install. Arturo has the schedule. Pru has the cases.

**LUIS**  
We're ready.

**CARLOS**  
We're ready.

**MIGUEL**  
We're ready.

**ARTURO**  
Tomorrow we rest. Day after we start. Luis first. We're not leaving until all three are live. You get us. Hands on. First major reboot initiative. Running the show.

They shake hands. Launch Week is over — connection, mountain, coast. The week of work is about to begin.

### CUT TO:

## ACT THREE: THE FIRST THREE INSTALL
### Hands On (~4,000 words)

---

### EXT. LUIS'S FACILITY - GATE - DAWN

Concrete. Fence. Refinery section. Quiet. ARTURO and PRU with two cases. Car behind them. LUIS at the gate.

**LUIS**  
No rip-and-replace.

**PRU**  
No rip-and-replace. We're adding a shell. You keep your SCADA. You keep your DCS. We sit on top. We read. We advise. We add the new layer. Your team keeps running the facility the same way. They just get more.

They go to the control room. Screens. Coffee. Team told to stay back but watch. Arturo and Pru open the cases. Run cable. Find the control bus. Tap in. They do not touch the existing SCADA. They do not touch the existing DCS. They add. Luis watches. His deputy watches. The work is careful. The work is quiet. By noon the cable is run. By afternoon the console is mounted. By evening the first link is live. Luis nods. You're not touching anything we need. Pru: We're not. We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have.

### CUT TO:

### INT. LUIS'S CONTROL ROOM - DAY TWO

The console is live. EGS SING! PETROCHEMICAL online. Routes. Visibility. Comms. Layered on top of what Luis already has. Luis runs a test. His deputy runs a test. The old gear still works. The new layer works on top. Nothing ripped out. Everything added.

**LUIS**  
It's real.

**ARTURO**  
It's real. And it's on your facility. You're the first. The first of three. We're here. We're running the show.

**LUIS**  
When do the other two go on?

**PRU**  
Carlos in two days. Miguel three days after that. We're not leaving until all three are live.

Luis shakes their hands. I'm holding you to it. And you held. Thank you.

### CUT TO:

### INT. CARLOS'S FACILITY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Smaller. Older. Arturo and Pru with the same cases. The same rule: add, don't replace. Carlos watches. Asks where the layer sits. What it reads. What it does. Pru shows him. We're not in the critical path. We're beside it. We see what you see. We add what you don't have. The install takes a day and a half. When the console comes alive Carlos smiles. I've been waiting for this. A layer. Something that doesn't throw away what I've got. You two built this at Interlink? Arturo: We built the idea. We're building the product now. You're number two. Luis's live. You're live. Miguel's next. Then we've run the show. First three. Done. Carlos raises a glass. To new energy. They all say it.

### CUT TO:

### INT. MIGUEL'S FACILITY - CONTROL ROOM - DAYS ONE, TWO, THREE

The biggest. PDVSA-linked. Forest of screens. Larger team. Day one: cable, map control bus, find comms paths. Don't touch SCADA. Don't touch DCS. Add. Day two: mount console, run taps, bring layer online. Day three: test. Run a test. Everything works. Old gear still works. New layer works on top. Miguel stands with his deputy and his team lead.

**MIGUEL**  
Three facilities. Three installs. You two did all of them. No subcontractors. Hands on. That's the story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Arturo's First Three. The Post-Singularity Energy Layer. We celebrated. We installed. We ran the show.

**ARTURO**  
One month in Venezuela. We're not done yet. We've got handover. We've got training. We've got your teams up to speed. But the first three are live. The gateway we built at Interlink is on your facilities. New energy. New visibility. New pathway. Real. PDVSA has always been the pioneer. Now it's real.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. GATE - LATE AFTERNOON - MONTH'S END

Pru and Arturo. Miguel's facility behind them. Sun going down. They have packed the cases. They have shaken Miguel's hand. They have said: we're not done. We've got handover. We've got training. But the install is complete. The first three are live. We run the show.

**ARTURO**  
That's the story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Seed was the message. Story was Launch Week and the first three install. Now it's done. Full. We ran the show.

They shake hands. One month in Venezuela. Not a demo. Not a simulation. Real product. Real installs. Real story. And the layer — the abstract layer that layered over all legacy systems — is on three facilities. New energy. New visibility. New pathway. Real. PDVSA has always been the pioneer. We run the show. Win win win win for all.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. VIBELANDIA-CARACAS - DAY

Pru and Arturo walk the space. The campus. The HQ. The people who will support the next installs. The next leads. The next facilities. The first three are live. The next will come. The network has woken. The story has spread.

**ARTURO**  
When you come back it'll be for the next three. Or the next ten. The story doesn't stop. Vibelandia-Caracas rolls out. Eventually Venezuela. First major reboot. You and me.

**PRU**  
The story doesn't stop. We run the show. Outdoor adventures and installs. Venezuela and USA. Together.

They stand there a while. The campus is quiet. The city is there. The month is over. The story is not.

### FADE OUT.
