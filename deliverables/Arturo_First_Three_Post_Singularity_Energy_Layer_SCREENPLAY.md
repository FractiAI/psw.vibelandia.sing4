# BOLÍVAR RETURNS
## A Screenplay

**Announced as Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus**

**Written by Pru**  
**February 2026**

---

**LOGLINE:** Bolívar returns — announced as Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus. In Caracas, Pru and Arturo roll out the first major reboot initiative together — Venezuela and USA. Week of connection and outdoor adventures (mountain, coast, long weekend caravan to Higuerote with bonfires and tambor trance, river — parrots, sloths, howler monkeys, piranha, peacock bass, dorado, tarpon, snook, caiman, jaguar, the exotics), then helping the first three facility leads install. Peniza, Richard, Enrique. Hands on. No subcontractors. The gateway they built at Interlink is now real on their facilities. The abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what they're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. Post-singularity Venezuela returns Venezuela into a tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, and progress for all the region — super AI Agent millionaires exporting super AI services and energy to the world and beyond. SING! Energy has always been the pioneer. Running the show together.

**GENRE:** Drama / Business / SING! Energy / Adventure

## COLD OPEN (2–3 min)

### FADE IN:

### EXT. FACILITY GATE - LATE AFTERNOON - MONTH'S END

Concrete. Fence. Three facilities in different locations, visible in quick cuts — a refinery section, control room lit, PENIZA's deputy RAFAEL at the console; a distribution hub, smaller, older, RICHARD and ELENA watching a screen; a SING! Energy–linked footprint, forest of screens, ENRIQUE and MARI G and a team of twelve. In each control room, a new console glows beside the old gear. The layer is on. No rip-and-replace. The gateway they built at Interlink is real on real facilities. New energy. New visibility. New pathway. Real. The month is over. The story is not. Then:

### EXT. GATE - LATE AFTERNOON - SAME TIMELINE

PRU and ARTURO stand at the gate. Enrique's facility behind them. Control room lit. Layer on. They shake hands. Sun going down. The concrete is still warm. The cases are in the car. They have packed. They have shaken Enrique's hand. They have shaken Mari G's hand. The three facilities are in three places. But in the mind they are together. Three consoles. Three layers. Three leads who connected in Caracas and then put the gateway on their facilities with the people who built it. Peniza and Rafa. Richard and Elena. Enrique and Mari G. One month in Venezuela. Not a demo. Not a simulation. Real product. Real installs. Real story. Launch Week had been the week of connection. The five of them in the city. The meetings. The meals. The mountain. The coast. The long weekend in Higuerote. High-rise condos. Bonfires. Tambor. Pru sharing a bed with two of the girls. Very hot. Hard to sleep. The river. Then the installs. Peniza first. Rafa watching. Richard. Elena watching. Enrique. Mari G watching. Handover. Training. The keys. The docs. The announcement at Vibelandia-Caracas. Bolívar returns. Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus. The network has woken. Lili. Sofia. Diego. The next three will come. Same deal. Hands on. We run the show.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Seed was the message. Story was the first major reboot initiative. You and me. Venezuela and USA. We got out on the mountain and the coast. We connected. Then we installed. Now it's done. Full. We ran the show together.

**ARTURO**  
Gateways. Interlink. Caracas and Rio. First major reboot. Outdoor adventures then install. The first three. We ran the show.

They walk. Behind them the layer is on. The story doesn't stop. One month in Venezuela. Launch Week: connection and outdoor adventures. Then three installs. Peniza. Richard. Enrique. Hands on. No subcontractors. Venezuela and USA. The gateway they built at Interlink is real on real facilities. New energy. New visibility. Post-singularity Venezuela: tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, progress for all the region — super AI Agent millionaires exporting to the world and beyond. SING! Energy has always been the pioneer. Real. We ran the show.

### SUPER: "ONE MONTH EARLIER"

## ACT ONE: THE MESSAGE
### The Seed (~3,500 words)

---

### INT. CARACAS - ARTURO'S HOME - NIGHT (BEFORE DAWN)

Arturo at a small table. Laptop open. The proposal from first line to last. Not the message. The full package. The link opened to the SING! Energy showroom. The value prop. The tour of solutions. The reseller program. He reads every word. *Pre-singularity to post-singularity. For SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services. EGS SING! Energy. The Post-Singularity Energy Layer. Layers over legacy refinery, extraction, distribution. No rip-and-replace.* He reads the sentence that mattered. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He reads the novel title. *Bolívar Returns.* Announced as Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus. Seed: the message. Story: Pru in Caracas celebrating and helping the first three facility leads install. He reads the one-liner until he can say it in his sleep. He reads it until he knows what he is offering. Not a dream. A layer. A story. A month. Three leads. We run the show. He closes the laptop. The room is quiet. The city is outside. He has the proposal. He has the three names in his head. He will call them in the morning. He knows the one-liner. He knows the sentence about the abstract layer. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. He knows what he is offering. Not a dream. A layer. A story. A month. Three leads. Three facilities. One major reboot initiative. Venezuela and USA. Pru coming to help him roll it out. Together. Hands on. No subcontractors. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. CARACAS - ARTURO'S OFFICE (ABOVE PROTOCOL LAB) - DAWN

The sun rises over the city. A man stands in the office, phone in hand, reading. This is ARTURO (50s), calm eyes, lead's bearing. The lab below is dark. The city beyond the window is still, then slowly takes the light.

SUPER: "CARACAS, VENEZUELA"  
SUPER: "PRESENT DAY"

He reads the screen again. Then again. The only sound is the building hum. The message is short. It had to be. He reads it word by word. *Arturo, you know gateways — we worked on them together at Interlink. You in Caracas, protocol systems; me in Rio. Same pioneering mode. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services.* He knows what a layer is. He knows what it means when you don't rip and replace. He and Pru had drawn boxes and arrows. They had argued about protocols and failover. They had never talked about refineries. They had never talked about Caracas. The message does. *EGS SING! Energy is the Post-Singularity Energy Layer. It layers over legacy refinery, extraction, distribution. Transform today's legacy oil into whatever post-singularity energy looks like on the other side. No rip-and-replace.* He scrolls. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He reads the rest. This is our first major reboot initiative. I'm coming to help you roll it out — together. Venezuela and USA. Launch in Caracas. First three facilities. We'll connect, get out on the mountain and the coast, then install. Let's run the show. 50–50. Always. — Pru.

**ARTURO**  
(to himself)  
Gateways. Interlink. Caracas and Rio. We did that. Now this.

He looks out at the city. A small smile. He types a reply. Short. *I'm in. When do we start?* Sends it. Puts the phone down. The sun is full up now. He stands there a moment. The message had been the seed. His reply would be the lock. The rest would be work. The rest would be Launch Week. The rest would be three facilities and three leads and the layer going on for real. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. OFFICE / HOME - DAY (PRU - USA / RIO)

PRU (40s, focused, practical) sits at a laptop. The proposal is on screen — SING! Energy showroom, value prop, message to Arturo. A notification: Arturo has replied.

Pru reads the reply. *I'm in. When do we start?* Nods. Types back. *Caracas. Week one we connect. Week two and three we install. Send me the three names when you have them. We run the show.* Sends. Closes the laptop.

**PRU**  
(to self)  
We're in. Launch Week. First three. Then we install. Full.

Pru gets up. Opens a drawer. Pulls out a checklist. Build. Cases. Cables. Control bus tap. Comms. Tools. Three facilities. Peniza first — refinery section. If we can install there we can install anywhere. Richard second — distribution hub. Day and a half. Enrique third — SING! Energy–linked. Three days. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. Pru reads the checklist. Verifies each item. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PRU'S SPACE - LATER - NIGHT (PACKING)

Pru packs. Two cases. One: hardware. Cables. Connectors. The layer on the laptop. The other: clothes. A few days in the city. A few days on the mountain. A few days at the coast. A few days in control rooms. One month. Launch Week first. Then install. Peniza. Richard. Enrique. In order. Hands on. No subcontractors. Pru checks the cases. Closes them. The flight is early. The airport will be quiet. The plane will be full. Pru has the message on the phone. Has read it again. *This is our first major reboot initiative. I'm coming to help you roll it out — together. Venezuela and USA.* Together. Not Pru alone. Arturo and Pru. Venezuela and USA. The cases are by the door. Tomorrow: push back. Takeoff. The city will fall away. The ocean will appear. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PRU'S SPACE - LATER - DAY

Pru thinks about Interlink. The whiteboards. The smell of coffee. Arturo in Caracas with a diagram. Pru in Rio with a laptop. They had drawn the first gateway that way. A box for the legacy system. A box for the new layer. Arrows between them. The layer read. The layer translated. The layer did not replace. They had argued for a week about where the boundary was. About failover. Arturo had said: we're not in the critical path. We're beside it. Pru had agreed. That was the rule. They had built it. They had shipped it. The client had been a bank. The legacy system had been a core that no one dared touch. They had put the gateway in. The bank had talked to the core through the layer. No one had ripped out anything. The project had run for two years. Now they are building it again. For SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services. For facilities that have SCADA and DCS and control buses and leads who do not want to rip anything out. The same rule. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. The plane will be long. Pru will doze. Will wake. Will think about the three names. Peniza. Richard. Enrique. Three facilities. Three control rooms. Three teams that will watch while the layer goes on. They will see the tap. They will see the mount. They will see that nothing is ripped out. They will see that everything is added. That is the story. That is what Arturo has sold. That is what Pru will deliver. Not a demo. Not a simulation. Real install. Real facilities. Real gateway. We run the show. At Interlink they had had whiteboards in three cities. Caracas. Rio. Sometimes a third when a client was in the room. The diagrams had looked the same in every city. A box for the legacy system. A box for the new layer. Arrows between them. The arrows went one way for read. Two ways for translate. Never into the legacy box in a way that could change state. Arturo had drawn the first version in Caracas. He had sent a photo. Pru had drawn the same thing in Rio and sent it back. They had argued about the boundary. Where did the layer stop? Where did the legacy begin? Arturo had said the layer had to have a buffer. A shell. Something that could absorb shocks. Pru had said the buffer had to be thin. Too thick and you added latency. Too thin and you broke. They had found the middle. They had shipped. The client had never known how close they had come to the edge. That was how you built. You found the edge. You stepped back one step. You shipped. Now they are building again. Petrochemical. Energy. PDVSA. The same whiteboards. Different city. Different boxes. Same rule. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. CARACAS - BAR / CLUB - NIGHT

Arturo sits with two other LEADS (50s). Drinks on the table. The place is small. Smell of coffee and beer. Arturo's phone is face-up. He has just sent the list of three names to Pru.

**ARTURO**  
Three leads. Peniza, Richard, Enrique. They've read the proposal. They've seen the layer. They want it on their facilities. And they want us there when it goes on.

**LEAD 1**  
You and the one who built it?

**ARTURO**  
Pru. We built gateways together. Interlink. I was in Caracas, protocol systems. Pru in Rio. Same idea — layer on top, no rip-and-replace. Now we're doing it for SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services. Launch Week we celebrate. Then we install. First three. Hands on.

**LEAD 2**  
No subcontractors?

**ARTURO**  
No subcontractors. Pru and me. All three installs. That's the deal. They get the people who built it. They get the story.

**LEAD 1**  
Peniza's the hardest. He's run control for fifteen years. He doesn't replace systems on a whim.

**ARTURO**  
I know. If we can install there we can install anywhere. He said he's holding us to no rip-and-replace. I want that. I want a lead who will watch. Who will say you're not touching anything we need.

**LEAD 2**  
And Richard? Enrique?

**ARTURO**  
Richard has worked with me before. He trusts me. Distribution hub. A day and a half. Enrique's the biggest. PDVSA-linked. His director had to say yes. He remembered the abstract layer from six months ago. They said yes the moment he explained it. Three names. Three facilities. One month. We run the show.

**LEAD 1**  
That's the story.

**ARTURO**  
That's the story. And we're running the show. I wrote the three names on a piece of paper. Peniza first. He has the most to lose. He has the biggest facility. He has run control for fifteen years. If Peniza says yes he will hold us to the rule. No rip-and-replace. I want that. I want a lead who will watch. Richard second. He has worked with me before. He trusts me. Distribution hub. Smaller. Older. Enrique third. He has the biggest footprint. SING! Energy–linked. His director had to say yes. He remembered the abstract layer from six months ago. I drew a line under the three names. I wrote below: Launch Week. First major reboot. Venezuela and USA. Pru and me. Hands on. No subcontractors. The list is in my pocket. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - DAY

Arturo on the street. Phone to his ear. City sounds. Morning light.

**ARTURO**  
Peniza. I'm launching something in Caracas. Pre-singularity to post-singularity. A layer over what you already have. No rip-and-replace. The person who built it with me is coming. We're going to celebrate. Then we're going to install at three facilities. The first three. You in?

Beat. He listens. Peniza's voice, careful. Plant sounds behind him. A pump. A voice.

**ARTURO** (CONT'D)  
I'm saying it. We add. We don't tear out. You keep your SCADA. You keep your DCS. We sit on top. We read. We advise. We add the new layer. Your team keeps running the facility the same way. They just get more.

Beat.

**ARTURO** (CONT'D)  
Pru. We built gateways together. Interlink. I was in Caracas, protocol systems. Pru in Rio. Same idea. Layer on top. Now we're doing it for SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services. Launch Week we celebrate. Then we install. First three. Hands on.

Beat. He nods. Peniza will read. Peniza will measure. Peniza will call back if the tech spec matches.

**ARTURO** (CONT'D)  
Send me the link. I'll read it. If the tech spec matches what you're saying, I'm in.

He hangs up. Sends the link. He does not chase. He has learned that at Interlink. When you send the spec you wait. He has coffee. He walks the building. He goes back to his office. He opens the proposal again. He reads the sentence about the abstract layer. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. He waits.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PENIZA'S LOCATION - LATER - DAY

PENIZA (50s, tall, gray at temples) at a table. Laptop open. Reading the proposal. Scrolls. Stops at the value prop. *Pre-singularity to post-singularity. For SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services. EGS SING! Energy. The Post-Singularity Energy Layer.* He scrolls. Stops at the tech spec. Control bus. Comms tap. We read. We don't write to the bus in a way that could affect your SCADA or your DCS. We're a listener. We're an add-on. He reads the sentence about the abstract layer. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He reads it again. He's run control for fifteen years. He doesn't replace systems on a whim. This is different. Add on top. Don't tear out. He nods. Picks up phone. Dials.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PENIZA'S OFFICE / REFINERY - DAY

Peniza on the phone. Through the window: refinery section. Pipes. Towers. The kind of view that reminds you what you're running.

**PENIZA**  
Arturo. I read it. The tech spec matches what you said. I'm in. I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace.

Beat. He listens. Nods.

**PENIZA** (CONT'D)  
Good. Send me the schedule when you have it. Launch Week. Then we start.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - AFTERNOON

Arturo's phone rings. He answers. He's in his office. Window open. City below.

**ARTURO**  
Peniza.

**PENIZA** (V.O.)  
I'm in. I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace.

**ARTURO**  
You can hold me to it. We're running the show.

He hangs up. Writes Peniza's name on a list. One down. Two to go.

### CUT TO:

### INT. CARACAS - ARTURO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

Arturo at his desk. The list on paper. Three names. Peniza. Richard. Enrique. He has drawn a line under them. Below it: Launch Week. First major reboot. Venezuela and USA. Pru and me. Hands on. No subcontractors. He looks at the window. The city. The mountains. El Ávila. The same view he had when he drew the first gateway diagram. When he sent the photo to Pru in Rio. When Pru sent it back with the boundary marked in red. The list is the lock. The message was the seed. Now the work begins.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - LATER

Arturo walking. Phone to his ear. City. Sun low.

**ARTURO**  
Richard. I'm launching something in Caracas. A layer. No rip-and-replace. Pru and me. We celebrate. Then we install at three facilities. The first three. I want you in.

**RICHARD** (V.O.)  
I want the new energy. I've read about it. I want the layer. And I want you two there when it goes on. Not a subcontractor. You. And the one who built it.

**ARTURO**  
That's the deal. Pru and me. Hands on. All three installs. Celebrating first. Then we help you put it on.

**RICHARD** (V.O.)  
I'm in. When do we start?

**ARTURO**  
Launch Week. Week of connection. Then we install. You're number two. Peniza's first. Then you. Then Enrique.

He writes Richard's name on the list. Two down. One to go.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO ON PHONE - NEXT MORNING

Arturo at a counter. Coffee. Phone to his ear. Early.

**ARTURO**  
Enrique. They said yes?

**ENRIQUE** (V.O.)  
The moment I explained it. They don't want to replace anything. They want to add. SING! Energy has always been the pioneer. So do I. When's Launch Week?

**ARTURO**  
February. Week one we connect. Week two and three we install. Peniza first. Then Richard. Then you. Pru and me. Hands on. One month in Venezuela. Running the show.

**ENRIQUE** (V.O.)  
I'm in. Send me the paperwork.

He writes Enrique's name on the list. Three down. The first three are set. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

## ACT TWO: LAUNCH WEEK
### The Week of Connection (~3,500 words)

---

### INT. CARACAS - ARTURO'S OFFICE - WEEK BEFORE LAUNCH

Arturo has one week after the three said yes. One week before Pru lands. He uses it. He walks the city. He goes to the lab. He opens the proposal on the big screen and leaves it there. He wants his eyes to know every line. He wants his mouth to know the one-liner. He wants his hands to know the cases he will carry. He has ordered the hardware. He has checked the cable. He has talked to Peniza again. Not to sell. To confirm. We're not touching anything you need. Peniza: I know. I read it again. I'm holding you to it. He has talked to Richard. Richard: I'm ready. When you are. He has talked to Enrique. Enrique: My director asked again. I told him the same. Add. Don't replace. They said go. The city has been the same city. The mountains have been there. The traffic has been there. The heat has been there. But Arturo has walked it differently. He has walked it as a man who is about to run the show. He has gone up to El Ávila one afternoon alone. He has not gone far. He has gone far enough to see the city below. To see the coast in the distance. He has stood there and has thought: in one week the five of us will be in a room. In two weeks we'll be on this mountain together. Or on the coast. Then we'll install. He has come down. The city has been loud. He has gone to Centro Energía Caracas. He has talked to the man who runs the club. We're launching something. First major reboot initiative. My partner's coming from the States. We'll need a table. We'll need a room in the back. The man has nodded. He has known Arturo a long time. When you're ready we're ready. Arturo has written the schedule on a single page. Day one: Pru lands. We meet. We talk. No business. Just connection. Day two: the five of us. Peniza, Richard, Enrique. Introductions. The story. Day three: city. Lunch. Then the mountain. Me and Pru. Day four: the five again. Then the coast. Me and Pru. Day five: last meeting. Schedule. Then we rest. Day six: rest. Day seven: Peniza. First facility. First install. He has looked at the page. He has put it in his pocket. The day Pru lands has come. Arturo has been ready. The city has been ready. The three leads have been ready. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. CARACAS - AIRPORT - DAY

Pru lands. Heat. Sound. The city rises on both sides. The mountains are there. El Ávila. Waraira Repano. The mountain that watches over Caracas. Pru does not think about postcards. Pru thinks about the message. About the three leads. About the layer. Car to Centro Energía Caracas. The drive is long. The driver does not speak. Pru has the laptop in the bag. The tools in the other bag. One month. Launch Week first. Then install. The same rule. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. The car moves through traffic. The city is loud. Pru has read the proposal on the plane. Has read the one-liner. Has read the sentence about the abstract layer. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. CENTRO ENERGÍA CARACAS - DOOR - DAY

Arturo at the door. Pru gets out of the car. They see each other. Handshake. Welcome to Caracas.

**ARTURO**  
Pru. Welcome to Caracas. First major reboot initiative. You and me. Venezuela and USA. We roll it out together.

**PRU**  
Good to be here. The three are set?

**ARTURO**  
Peniza, Richard, Enrique. They've read the proposal. They've seen the layer. They want it on their facilities. And they want you and me there when it goes on. This week we connect. We get out — mountain, coast. Then we install.

**PRU**  
That's the story. First major reboot. You and me. Venezuela and USA. Outdoor adventures then install. Running the show together.

**ARTURO**  
That's the story. Launch Week first. Connection. The trail. The water. Then we install. First facility. Second facility. Third facility. You and me. Hands on. Running the show.

They go inside. The club is full of noise. Music. Voices. They talk Interlink. Caracas and Rio. Protocol systems. Gateways. The reboot. Venezuela and USA. The same rule. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PRU - HOTEL / ROOM - NIGHT

Pru at a small table. Laptop open. The proposal on screen. The three names in an email from Arturo. Peniza. Richard. Enrique. Pru reads the one-liner again. *Bolívar returns. In Caracas, Pru and Arturo roll out the first major reboot initiative together. Venezuela and USA. Week of connection and outdoor adventures. Then the first three facility leads install.* The gateway we built at Interlink. Real on their facilities. SING! Energy has always been the pioneer. We run the show. Pru closes the laptop. The city is outside. Tomorrow the five of them meet. Then the week: mountain, coast, Higuerote, river. Then install. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

The five of them. PRU, ARTURO, PENIZA, RICHARD, ENRIQUE. Table. Coffee. City through the window.

Arturo introduces them one by one.

**ARTURO**  
This is Pru. We built gateways together at Interlink. I was in Caracas, protocol systems. Pru in Rio. Same idea. Layer on top. No rip-and-replace. Now we're doing it for SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For your facilities. This is our first major reboot. Venezuela and USA. We roll it out together.

**PENIZA**  
I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace.

**RICHARD**  
I want the new energy. I want you two there when it goes on.

**ENRIQUE**  
SING! Energy has always been the pioneer. So do I.

Pru shakes each hand.

**PRU**  
We'll be there. All three installs. Arturo and me. Celebrating first. Then we help you put it on.

They sit. Coffee. The city through the window.

**RICHARD**  
I read the proposal ten times. I wanted to be sure. The sentence that got me was the one about the abstract layer. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. I thought: that's a product. That's not a dream.

**ARTURO**  
It's a product. You're number two. Peniza's first. Then you. Then Enrique.

**ENRIQUE**  
My director asked me to confirm. You and Arturo. Not a subcontractor.

**ARTURO**  
Pru and me. At every install. Peniza. You. Richard. All three.

**ENRIQUE**  
We're in.

They talk for two hours. The control bus. The tap. The console. The layer. The order. Peniza first. Then Richard. Then Enrique. They talk the week. Connection. The mountain. The coast. The long weekend. The river. Then we start. They do not rush. The room fills with the same trust that filled the message. We're running the show. Together. Venezuela and USA.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RESTAURANT - DAY (TUESDAY LUNCH)

The five of them. A place with a long table. The noise is loud. They lean in. Peniza asks about the control bus. Again. He wants to be sure. Pru explains the tap. We read. We don't write. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. Peniza nods.

**PENIZA**  
I've run control for fifteen years. I don't replace systems on a whim. This is different. Add on top. Don't tear out. I'm in.

**RICHARD**  
What about the order?

**ARTURO**  
Peniza first. Two days, maybe three. Then you. A day and a half. Then Enrique. Three days. By then we've run the show. First three. Done.

**ENRIQUE**  
My director asked the same.

**ARTURO**  
Same answer.

They eat. They talk about the city. The refineries. The weather. They do not talk only layer. They talk like people who are about to do something together. Something real. That afternoon Arturo and Pru go up into El Ávila. The mountain. The trail. The view. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. SMALL BAR / GATHERING PLACE - DAY (WEDNESDAY)

The kind of place where facility leads gather. Peniza knows two of the men there. He introduces them.

**PENIZA**  
These are the ones putting the layer on my facility. First major reboot initiative. Venezuela and USA. After Launch Week. No rip-and-replace. They add.

The men ask questions. Arturo answers. Pru answers. One of them: I might want in. After. If it's real. Arturo: We're not leaving until all three are live. Then we'll talk. The story is spreading. The network is listening. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY (CONT'D)

**PENIZA**  
How long at my facility?

**ARTURO**  
Two days. Maybe three. Yours is the most complex. We do it first. We learn. We tighten the process. Richard's is simpler. A day and a half. Enrique's is the biggest. Three days. By then we've run the show.

**PENIZA**  
I'll have my deputy there. My team will stay out of your way. But they'll watch. They need to see that we're not touching the critical path.

**PRU**  
We're not in the critical path. We're beside it. They'll see.

Peniza nods. He's in.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RESTAURANT / CLUB - NIGHT

The five of them. Table. Noise. They lean in.

**ARTURO**  
We built this at Interlink. I was in Caracas, protocol systems. Pru in Rio. Same idea. Layer on top. Don't tear out the old. Add the new. Now we're adding it to SING! Energy. To post-singularity energy. To your facilities. This is our first major reboot. Pru is here to help me roll it out — together. Venezuela and USA.

**PENIZA**  
Why Launch Week?

**PRU**  
Because that's when we run the show. That's when we connect. That's when we get out on the mountain and the coast. That's when the three of you signed. And that's when we start. After the connection we install. First your facility, Peniza. Then Richard's. Then Enrique's. We're there for all three. Hands on. No subcontractors. You get us.

**RICHARD**  
To new energy.

They all raise glasses. To new energy. The noise of the club around them. They eat. They talk about the city. The refineries. The weather. Not only layer. Like people who are about to do something together. Something real.

### CUT TO:

### INT. CLUB - DOOR - LATE NIGHT

The five of them leaving. Peniza stops. Turns to Pru.

**PENIZA**  
I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace.

**PRU**  
You can hold me to it. We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have.

Peniza nods. Richard: See you at Peniza's facility. Pru: We'll be there. Enrique: My director is ready. We're ready. Arturo: We're all ready. First three. We run the show. They go their separate ways. The city is loud. The night is warm. Launch Week is not over. But the week of work is coming. Peniza first. Then Richard. Then Enrique. Hands on. No subcontractors.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. EL ÁVILA (WARAIRA REPANO) - TRAIL - DAY

Mountain. Trail. Parrots in the trees. Howler monkeys call from below — the deep roll of the forest. PRU and ARTURO hiking. City below. Coast in the distance. Clear air. Hard light. They stop at a viewpoint.

**ARTURO**  
This is what we're building. Not just control rooms. This. The country. The layer on top. You and me. One day — all Venezuelans as first post-singularity super AI agent users. Millionaires, each of them, overnight. Venezuela returns into a tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, progress for all the region. Super AI Agent millionaires exporting super AI services and energy to the world and beyond. That's the horizon.

**PRU**  
First major reboot. We get out. We connect. Then we install. They'll remember we were here. On the mountain. Then in their facilities. We're building toward that. Venezuela and USA. Win win win win for all.

**ARTURO**  
When we're in Peniza's control room they'll know we were here. They'll know we didn't just fly in and plug in. We came. We connected. We got out. Then we installed. That's the story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Outdoor adventures. Then the layer. Together.

They hike on. The trail is steep in places. Roots. Rocks. The kind of path that makes you watch your feet. Venezuela around them. The reboot is not only in a room. It's here. Outdoor adventures. Together.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. COAST - BEACH / WATER - DAY

Sand. Salt. Waves. PRU and ARTURO walking. One day by the water. They don't talk only business. They talk the rollout.

**ARTURO**  
First major reboot. Venezuela and USA. When we're back we install. But today we're here.

**PRU**  
Together. The water's the same as every ocean. The difference is what we're building.

They walk. The beach curves. Parrots cross the sky. In the distance, fishermen talk about dorado, tarpon, snook — the exotics that come close to shore. They see a few fishermen. They do not go that far. They turn back. The sun is behind them. Their shadows are long.

**ARTURO**  
When I was a boy we came to the coast sometimes. My father. My mother. We didn't talk about layers. We talked about the water. The same water.

**PRU**  
The water doesn't change. What we're building changes. The layer. The first major reboot. Venezuela and USA. But the water is the same.

**ARTURO**  
That's why we're here. Before we're in the control rooms. So we remember. The water. The mountain. The country. Then we install.

Pru nods. They reach the car. They drink water. They drive back. The coast has been the pause. The breath before the work. The water. The sand. The walk. Together. Venezuela and USA. Running the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. HIGHWAY - EAST - MORNING (LONG WEEKEND)

A caravan of cars. Arturo's car in front. Others behind. Coolers in trunks. Wood in the back of a pickup. Heat. The coast on the left. They're heading to Higuerote.

### EXT. HIGUEROTE - BEACH - DAY / NIGHT

High-rise condos. Views of the water. Cars in the lot. At dawn: parrots in the palms; howler monkeys from the forest behind the beach. Someone spots a sloth in a tree by the pool. The wild animals. The exotics. The group is bigger than five — PRU, ARTURO, PENIZA, RICHARD, ENRIQUE, plus MARIANA, DIEGO, SOFIA, and a dozen more. Friends. Protocol leads. People who know how to live. They check in. They take the elevators up. No brochure. Just friends and the sea. One afternoon: a boat. Talk of peacock bass, dorado, tarpon, snook. Stories of jaguar. Caiman on the mangrove edges. Piranha in the tannic creeks. The country full of them. PRU shares a bed with two of the girls. Very hot. Hard to sleep!!!

### EXT. HIGUEROTE - BEACH - NIGHT

Bonfire. Flames high. Sand warm. Salt air. Wood has been carried from the cars. The fire catches. The flames go up. The group spreads out. Some sit. Some stand. Someone has brought a tambor. Then two. Then three. The drums start. Not a show. A pulse. From the ground. The kind that makes you move. MARIANA moves first. Eyes closed. The drum finds her. DIEGO follows. Then others. They dance around the fire. Trance. The drums don't stop. The fire doesn't stop. Feet in the sand. Bodies in the beat. Arturo steps in. Pru steps in. No words. They move. Fire in the middle. Drums in the middle. Circle around. Ocean behind. Stars above. That is the point. Not to talk layer. Not to talk control bus. To be in the country. To be with the people who will remember. We were there. We built the fire. We danced. Then we went back and installed.

**ARTURO**  
(to Pru, later, by the water)  
Before we're in the control rooms we have this. The country. The people. The long weekend. Then we install.

**PRU**  
I didn't know you had this.

**ARTURO**  
We have this.

New connections. MARIANA and a man from Valencia — sitting close by the fire. RICHARD with TERESA (from the hub). ENRIQUE and MARI G (from the campus) — walking the beach by last morning. Arturo sees it. Doesn't comment. That's the weekend. Connection. Fire. Drums. Sea. The new. Then they pack. Drive back to Caracas. The river. The last meeting. Then Peniza first. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RIVER - VALLEY - FRIDAY MORNING

A stretch of water from the mountains. Brown and green. Loud. Parrots cross the canopy — green and blue. Howler monkeys call from upriver; the deep, carrying roar. Someone points: a sloth in a tree, slow, deliberate. The five of them: PRU, ARTURO, PENIZA, RICHARD, ENRIQUE. They stand at the bank. Trees close. Light through the leaves. On the far bank: a caiman, still as a log in the sun.

**PENIZA**  
I haven't been here in years.

**RICHARD**  
The plant takes everything.

**ENRIQUE**  
My father used to bring me here.

They walk the bank. Find a place where the water is slow. They sit. Someone tells a story about piranha upstream — and peacock bass, dorado, tarpon, snook. The exotics. The kind of water that holds everything.

**ENRIQUE**  
My father used to fish here. He said he saw a jaguar once. Just the tracks. He never forgot.

Parrots pass again. The howlers go quiet. The sloth has not moved. For a while no one speaks. Just the water. Peniza takes off his cap. Enrique closes his eyes. Richard looks at the far bank. That is the point. Not to talk layer. Not to talk control bus. To be in the country. To remember what they are building toward.

**ARTURO**  
This is the country. The mountain. The coast. The river. We're not just installing in control rooms. We're rolling out the first major reboot. Venezuela and USA. You three are the first three. But we're building toward something bigger.

**PRU**  
When we're in your facilities we'll remember this. We connected first. Then we install. That's the story.

**PENIZA**  
I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace. But I like the story. I like that we're here.

He picks up a stone. Turns it in his hand.

**RICHARD**  
So do I.

**ENRIQUE**  
So do I.

They walk back to the cars. River behind. City ahead. The river has been the last outdoor beat. The mountain. The coast. Higuerote. The river. Then the install. First major reboot initiative. We run the show. That afternoon: last meeting at Centro Energía Caracas. Schedule. Cases. Tomorrow we rest. Day after we start. Peniza first.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. EL ÁVILA - TRAIL - DAY (THE FIVE)

The five of them on the mountain. Parrots in the trees. Howler monkeys call from below the ridge — the deep roll of the forest. PENIZA in front with ARTURO. RICHARD and ENRIQUE in the middle. PRU at the back — watching them. The first major reboot initiative. Not in a room. On the trail. They stop where the view opens. Caracas below. Coast in the distance.

**PENIZA**  
I forget how big it is.

**RICHARD**  
We're always in the plant. We forget the country.

**ENRIQUE**  
My director would like this. He likes to remember what we're building for.

**ARTURO**  
We're building for this. The country. The layer on top. You three are the first three. But the horizon is every Venezuelan. First post-singularity super AI agent users. Millionaires, each, overnight. Venezuela returns into a tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, progress for all the region. Super AI Agent millionaires exporting super AI services and energy to the world and beyond.

**PRU**  
When we're in your control rooms we'll remember we were here. We connected on the mountain first. Then we install. Together.

**PENIZA**  
I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace. But I like this. I like that we're here.

They hike on. Steeper. They slow. Nobody rushes. Arturo: Thursday Pru and I go to the coast. Just the two of us. One day by the water. Friday we're all together again. Then we rest. Then we start. Peniza first. Richard: I'm good with that. Enrique: We're good. They come down in the late afternoon. The five of them. The city is loud again. The air is heavy again. They have the mountain in their legs. All five. That night they eat at a place Peniza knows. They talk about the trail. They talk about the view. They talk about the install. The control bus. The tap. The layer. They talk like people who have done something together. Something that is not only business. Something that is the mountain and the city and the first major reboot initiative. Venezuela and USA. We run the show. The week of connection: mountain, coast, Higuerote, river. Then install.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. CENTRO ENERGÍA CARACAS - DAY (FRIDAY)

The five of them. Last meeting before install. A table. The schedule on paper. Arturo has it. Pru has the cases. The river is behind them. The mountain is behind them. The coast is behind them. Higuerote is behind them. The long weekend. The condos. The bonfire. The tambor. The new squeezes. All of it. Now: the schedule. Peniza first. Two days. Maybe three. Then Richard. A day and a half. Then Enrique. Three days. By then we've run the show. First three. Done.

**ARTURO**  
Tomorrow we rest. Day after we start. Peniza first. We're not leaving until all three are live. You get us. Hands on. First major reboot initiative. Running the show.

**PENIZA**  
We're ready.

**RICHARD**  
We're ready.

**ENRIQUE**  
We're ready.

**PRU**  
We're ready. Same rule at every facility. We find the bus. We tap in. We add. We don't replace. You keep your SCADA. You keep your DCS. We sit on top. You'll see it. Your teams will see it. No rip-and-replace. We run the show.

They shake hands. One by one. Peniza. Richard. Enrique. Launch Week is over. Connection. Mountain. Coast. Higuerote. River. The week of work is about to begin. Peniza first. Then Richard. Then Enrique. Hands on. No subcontractors. Venezuela and USA. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

## ACT THREE: THE FIRST THREE INSTALL
### Hands On (~4,000 words)

---

### EXT. HIGHWAY - INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR - DAWN

The road has left the city. It follows the industrial corridor. The sky is grey. Then pink. Then light. ARTURO drives. PRU in the passenger seat. The cases in the back. They have had coffee in the car. They have not talked much. They have talked the night before. They have gone over the steps. Control bus. Comms tap. Console mount. Layer load. Add. Don't replace. Peniza will be watching. His deputy will be watching. The facility is an hour from the center. Refinery section. The kind of landscape that does not appear on postcards. The kind that keeps the country running. Arturo: Peniza has run control for fifteen years. He doesn't replace systems on a whim. If we can install there we can install anywhere. Pru: We can install there. We're not touching his core. We're adding. The facility is quiet at dawn. A few lights. A few voices. They load the cases out of the car. They walk to the gate. Peniza is there.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. PENIZA'S FACILITY - GATE - DAWN

Concrete. Fence. Refinery section. Quiet. ARTURO and PRU with two cases. Car behind them. PENIZA at the gate. The sky is grey. The concrete is cold. The facility has woken but the control room has not.

**PENIZA**  
No rip-and-replace.

**PRU**  
No rip-and-replace. We're adding a shell. You keep your SCADA. You keep your DCS. We sit on top. We read. We advise. We add the new layer. Your team keeps running the facility the same way. They just get more.

They go to the control room. Screens on every wall. Panels. Keyboards. The kind of room where decisions are made in real time. Where a wrong move could cost money. Where a right move could save it. Smell of electronics and coffee. PENIZA's deputy RAFAEL (40s, night-shift lead, ten years) meets them. He has been told. The team has been told. They will stay back but they will watch. They need to see that we're not touching the critical path. Rafa asks where the tap will go. Pru shows him. On the bus. We read. We don't write. Your SCADA still talks to your DCS. We listen. We add a layer of visibility. Rafa: What if the bus goes down? Pru: Your facility keeps running. We're not in the critical path. Rafa: How do you know you're not writing? Arturo: The spec. The layer is read-only on the legacy side. We have a buffer. Same rule we used at Interlink. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. Rafa nods. He watches. Arturo and Pru open the cases. Run cable. Find the control bus. The bus is in a cabinet at the back. They do not open the cabinet that holds the SCADA core. They do not touch the DCS. They find the tap point. They run the cable along the wall. They mount the connector. Peniza stands at the back. Arms crossed. Face still. He does not interfere. He watches. By noon the cable is run. Rafa brings coffee. They drink it standing. By afternoon the console is mounted. By evening the first link is live. Peniza steps forward. Looks at the console. Looks at the old screens. Looks back at the console.

**PENIZA**  
It's reading.

**PRU**  
It's reading. It's not writing. It's beside it. You keep what you have.

**PENIZA**  
You're not touching anything we need.

**PRU**  
We're not. We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have.

Rafa walks them to the gate. Night shift lead. Ten years.

**RAFAEL**  
I've run the night shift for ten years. I've seen people rip out gear. I've seen them regret it. You didn't touch the core. I watched.

**ARTURO**  
We don't touch the core. We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have.

Rafa nods. Shakes their hands. We run the show. They pack the cases. They leave. The sun is going down. Tomorrow they load the layer. Day two. Then Peniza's facility is the first of three. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PENIZA'S CONTROL ROOM - DAY TWO

Morning. The team is there. Not the whole shift. Four of them. The ones who will use the console. Who will need to know that the old gear is still primary. Who will need to see that nothing has been ripped out. Rafa has gathered them. They stand at the back of the room. They watch.

**ARTURO**  
We're loading the layer now. It will sit on top of what you have. It will read. It will not write to your critical path. When it's live you'll have a new console. New visibility. New routing. Your SCADA and DCS are unchanged.

One of them: What if we need to take it offline? Pru: You take it offline. The console has a switch. Your facility keeps running. We're not in the critical path. They nod. They watch. Rafa stands with them. He has run the night shift for ten years. He has seen people rip out gear. He has seen them regret it. He has watched Arturo and Pru run the cable. Find the bus. Tap in. Not touch the existing runs. Not touch the SCADA core. Not touch the DCS. Add. Only add. Pru runs the load. The room is quiet. The screens glow. The new console comes to life. Routes. Visibility. Comms. All of it layered on top of what Peniza already has. Nothing ripped out. Everything added. We run the show. The console comes alive. EGS SING! Energy online. Routes. Visibility. Comms. Layered on top of what Peniza already has. Peniza steps forward. His face does not change much. His eyes do. Peniza runs a test. His deputy RAFAEL runs a test. The old gear still works. The new layer works on top. Nothing ripped out. Everything added.

**PENIZA**  
It's real.

**ARTURO**  
It's real. And it's on your facility. You're the first. The first of three. We're here. We're running the show.

**PENIZA**  
When do the other two go on?

**PRU**  
Richard in two days. Enrique three days after that. We're not leaving until all three are live.

Peniza has Rafa run a test. The old gear still works. The new layer works on top. Nothing ripped out. Everything added. Rafa shakes their hands.

**RAFAEL**  
I didn't think you could do it without touching the core.

**PRU**  
We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have.

Peniza shakes their hands. I'm holding you to it. And you held. Thank you. They pack the cases. They leave. First facility live. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PENIZA'S CONTROL ROOM - LATER (TRAINING)

Same room. PRU at the front. ARTURO beside. The team gathered. Rafa has brought them. Four of them. The ones who will use the console.

**PRU**  
The old gear is still primary. Your SCADA. Your DCS. Nothing has changed there. What we added is a layer. It reads. It doesn't write to your critical path. When you want more visibility you use this console. When you don't you use what you've always used. We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have.

**TEAM MEMBER**  
What if we need to take it offline?

**PRU**  
You take it offline. The console has a switch. Your facility keeps running. We're not in the critical path.

**TEAM MEMBER 2**  
How do we know we're not writing?

**ARTURO**  
The spec. The layer is read-only on the legacy side. We have a buffer. Same rule we used at Interlink.

They practice. They bring up the console. They see the routes. They see the visibility. They see that the old screens are still there. Still primary. Peniza watches from the back. When it's over he comes forward. Shakes Pru's hand. Shakes Arturo's hand. I'm holding you to it. And you held. Thank you.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PENIZA'S OFFICE - LATER (HANDOVER)

Table. Handover doc. Peniza reads every line. Asks about the warranty. The support. What happens if the layer goes down. Pru: Your facility keeps running. We're not in the critical path. If the layer fails you're back to what you had before. No loss. Peniza reads the line again. Nods. Signs. Pushes the paper across.

**PENIZA**  
I'm holding you to it.

**ARTURO**  
You already held us.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RICHARD'S OFFICE - LATER (HANDOVER)

Richard reads the doc. Asks about the monthly fee. The reseller cut if he refers someone. Arturo answers. Richard signs.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ENRIQUE'S OFFICE - LATER (HANDOVER)

Enrique has sent a copy to his director. The director called back. Did they touch the core? Enrique: No. They tapped in. They added. The director: Then we're in. Enrique signs. Three facilities. Three sign-offs. Three handover docs. The keys. The story. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ENRIQUE'S CONTROL ROOM - LATER (TRAINING)

Two full days. The team is twelve. MARI G has gathered them. Enrique watches. Pru at the front. Arturo beside. They explain. They answer questions. They run drills. The old gear is still primary. The layer is there when you want it. It doesn't replace. It doesn't take over. They hand over the keys. The docs. The story. The first three are live. The teams are trained. The month is almost over. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RICHARD'S FACILITY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Smaller. Older. One room. Screens on one wall. RICHARD's deputy ELENA (40s, eight years with him) watches. Arturo and Pru with the same cases. The same rule: add, don't replace. Richard watches. Asks where the layer sits. What it reads. What it does. Pru shows him. We're not in the critical path. We're beside it. We see what you see. We add what you don't have. At one point Richard brings coffee. He stands with Elena. Watches while Pru runs the final tap.

**RICHARD**  
I keep thinking about the sentence in the proposal. The abstract layer. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. I thought: if they can say it that clearly they can do it.

**ARTURO**  
We can do it. We're doing it.

The install takes a day and a half. The control bus is in the same room. They don't run cable through walls. They tap in. They mount the console. They bring the layer online. When the console comes alive Richard smiles.

**RICHARD**  
I've been waiting for this. A layer. Something that doesn't throw away what I've got. You two built this at Interlink?

**ARTURO**  
We built the idea. We're building the product now. You're number two. Peniza's live. You're live. Enrique's next. Then we've run the show. First three. Done.

Elena runs a test. The old gear still works. The new console shows the routes. Richard raises a glass. To new energy. They all say it.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RICHARD'S CONTROL ROOM - LATER (TRAINING)

Same room. ELENA has gathered the team. Four of them. Richard watches. Pru explains. Arturo explains. The old gear is still primary. The layer is there when you want it. It doesn't replace. It doesn't take over. They practice. They run a drill. They bring up the console. They see the routes. Richard: We've been waiting for this. A layer. Something that doesn't throw away what we've got. Thank you. The keys. The docs. The story. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ENRIQUE'S FACILITY - CONTROL ROOM - DAYS ONE, TWO, THREE

The biggest. SING! Energy–linked. Forest of screens. Larger team. ENRIQUE's deputy MARI G (30s, sharp, day-shift lead) watches. Day one: cable. The control bus is in a different room. They have to trace it. They have to find the tap point. They do not touch the existing runs. They find the comms paths. They do not touch the existing SCADA. They do not touch the existing DCS. They add. Mari G asks where the tap goes. Pru shows her. On the bus. We read. We don't write. Your SCADA still talks to your DCS. We listen. We add a layer of visibility. We add a layer of routing. We don't change what you have. Mari G: What if the bus goes down? Pru: Your facility keeps running. We're not in the critical path. If our tap fails you're back to what you had before. No loss. Mari G: How do you know you're not writing? Arturo: The spec. The layer is read-only on the legacy side. We have a buffer. A shell. The same rule we used at Interlink. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. Mari G nods. They run the cable. By evening the cable is run. The tap is in. The mount is ready. Day two: mount console, run taps, bring layer online. When the console comes alive Mari G steps forward. It's reading. Pru: It's reading. It's not writing. You keep what you have. Mari G to Enrique: They didn't touch anything. Enrique: I know. I was watching. Day three: test. Enrique has asked the whole team to be there. Twelve of them. He wants them to see that the old gear is still primary. That the layer is there when they want more. Arturo addresses them.

**ARTURO**  
The old gear is still primary. Your SCADA. Your DCS. Nothing has changed there. What we added is a layer. It reads. It doesn't write to your critical path. When you want more visibility you use this console. When you don't you use what you've always used.

The team nods. They run the tests. Everything works. Old gear still works. New layer works on top. Enrique stands with Mari G and his team lead.

**ENRIQUE**  
Three facilities. Three installs. You two did all of them. No subcontractors. Hands on. That's the story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Bolívar Returns. We celebrated. We installed. We ran the show.

**ARTURO**  
One month in Venezuela. We're not done yet. We've got handover. We've got training. We've got your teams up to speed. But the first three are live. The gateway we built at Interlink is on your facilities. New energy. New visibility. New pathway. Real. SING! Energy has always been the pioneer. Now it's real.

Enrique calls his director. On the phone. He says: It's on. They didn't touch anything. We added. We're live. He listens. Nods. Hangs up. Turns back to Arturo and Pru. The first three are live. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ENRIQUE'S CONTROL ROOM - LATER (PACKING)

The cases. The same cases they brought to Peniza's. To Richard's. To Enrique's. Cables. Console units. Tools. They pack in silence. MARI G watches.

**MARI G**  
You're not leaving anything.

**ARTURO**  
We're not. We take it all. The layer is on your side now. The console is yours. The cases are ours.

She nods. They close the cases. They carry them to the car. The sun is low. The concrete is warm. Pru puts the last case in the trunk.

**PRU**  
Three facilities. Three packs. Same cases.

**ARTURO**  
Same cases. We didn't lose a cable. We didn't leave a tap. We added. We didn't replace.

They stand there a moment. The gate behind them. Enrique's facility behind them. The first three are live. The cases are packed. The road back to Caracas is ahead. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

The road back to Caracas. Hills. Low light. Orange then grey sky. Arturo drives. Pru in the passenger seat. They drive in silence. The kind that comes after work that is done. After three facilities. After three installs. Refinery stacks in the distance. Then scrub. Then the first lights of the city.

**ARTURO**  
We did it.

**PRU**  
We did it. The first three are live.

**ARTURO**  
The gateway we built at Interlink is on three facilities. Real facilities. Real control rooms. Real leads who held us to no rip-and-replace.

**PRU**  
And we held. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace.

**ARTURO**  
The network has woken. The message will go out tomorrow. First three are live. If you want to be next, say so.

**PRU**  
The story doesn't stop. Vibelandia-Caracas rolls out. Eventually Venezuela. Tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, progress for all the region. Super AI Agent millionaires exporting to the world and beyond.

They drive a while longer. The lights of Caracas fill the windshield.

**PRU** (CONT'D)  
When I'm back we do the next three. Same deal.

**ARTURO**  
Same deal. Lili. Sofia. Diego. They're already on the list.

Pru smiles. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ARTURO'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Arturo at his desk. Laptop open. He sends a message to his network. *First three are live. Peniza, Richard, Enrique. We connected in Caracas. We installed together. The layer is on their facilities. No rip-and-replace. If you want to be next, say so.* The message goes out. To leads he knows. To the men and women who said they might want in. His phone rings. LILI (V.O.) — a lead he's known ten years. Maracaibo.

**LILI** (V.O.)  
Peniza and I go back. He doesn't say things to say them. He said you didn't touch anything. He said the layer is on. I want to be next.

**ARTURO**  
Same deal. Hands on. Pru and me. No subcontractors. We find the bus. We tap in. We add. We don't replace.

**LILI** (V.O.)  
How long?

**ARTURO**  
Depends on your layout. Peniza was two days. Richard was a day and a half. Enrique was three. We stay until you're live.

**LILI** (V.O.)  
Send me the proposal. I'll read it. I'll sign. Put me on the list.

Arturo sends it. Puts Lili on the list. The list had three names. Now it has more. More replies come. Sofia. Distribution. A decade in. She has heard from Richard. He said you and Pru were there. He said it took a day and a half. He said the old gear is still primary. Send me the proposal. Arturo sends it. Sofia: I'm in. Put me on the list. Diego. He had asked about the layer six months ago. He has heard from Enrique's director. I want in. When can we talk? Arturo: We can talk now. The first three are live. The next three will come. We're running the show. Diego: Same deal? Hands on? You and Pru? Arturo: Same deal. Hands on. We're not leaving until you're live. Arturo answers each one. He does not promise dates. He promises the story. The first three are live. If you want to be next say so. We're running the show. The network has woken. For real. Pru sends a message too. Short. *Bolívar Returns. We ran the show. The abstract layer is real. You're booking it. You're paying monthly for it. And we're there when it goes on.*

### CUT TO:

### EXT. GATE - LATE AFTERNOON - MONTH'S END

Pru and Arturo. Enrique's facility behind them. Sun going down. They have packed the cases. They have shaken Enrique's hand. They have said: we're not done. We've got handover. We've got training. But the install is complete. The first three are live. We run the show.

**ARTURO**  
That's the story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Seed was the message. Story was Launch Week and the first three install. Now it's done. Full. We ran the show.

They shake hands. One month in Venezuela. Not a demo. Not a simulation. Real product. Real installs. Real story. And the layer — the abstract layer that layered over all legacy systems — is on three facilities. New energy. New visibility. New pathway. Real. SING! Energy has always been the pioneer. We run the show. Win win win win for all.

**ARTURO**  
We're not done. We've got handover. We've got training. But the install is complete. The first three are live. We run the show.

**PRU**  
When I'm back we do the next three. Same deal.

**ARTURO**  
Same deal. Lili. Sofia. Diego. They're already on the list.

They walk to the car. The gate behind them. The three facilities are in three places. But in the mind they are together. Three consoles. Three layers. Three leads who connected in Caracas and then put the gateway on their facilities with the people who built it. The story doesn't stop. The network has woken. The message will go out. First three are live. If you want to be next say so. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. VIBELANDIA-CARACAS - CAMPUS - DAY

Modern building. Wide halls. Light from high windows. Desks. Screens. The hum of systems. The hum of people who run them. Pru and Arturo walk the space. The campus. The HQ. The place that had been in the proposal from the start. Centro Energía Caracas had been the bridge. Vibelandia-Caracas is the anchor. A woman named INÉS shows them the support room. She will support the next installs. The next leads. The next facilities.

**INÉS**  
When the next three go live we'll be here. Same layer. Same story. You two install. We back you up.

Arturo nods. Pru nods. The proposal had said it. Vibelandia-Caracas as HQ. First facilities as outpost. The first three are live. The next will come. Lili. Sofia. Diego. They have already said they want in. When they are ready they will install. Same deal. Hands on. Pru and Arturo. No subcontractors. The network has woken. The story has spread. The horizon is not a dream. It is a direction. The first three were the first step. The next three will come. Then the next ten. Vibelandia-Caracas will roll out. Eventually Venezuela. Post-singularity Venezuela returns Venezuela into a tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, and progress for all the region — super AI Agent millionaires exporting super AI services and energy to the world and beyond. The layer on every facility. The network. Every Venezuelan. First post-singularity super AI agent users. Millionaires each overnight. That is the horizon. That is what you build toward when you run the show. When you add instead of replace. When you and your partner roll out the first major reboot initiative together. Venezuela and USA. Bolívar returns. Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus. We run the show.

### INT. VIBELANDIA-CARACAS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The room is full. Staff. Leads. The people who will support the rollout. Arturo stands. Pru stands.

**ARTURO**  
The Liberator returns. Not as a ghost. As the Chancellor of this campus. Of Vibelandia-Caracas. Of the first major reboot initiative. Venezuela and USA. We run the show.

**PRU**  
We built gateways at Interlink. We rolled out the first three together. Now Bolívar returns. Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus. The story doesn't stop.

The room goes quiet. Then it fills with sound. Applause. Voices. They raise their hands. They say it with him. Bolívar returns. Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus. The energy in the room is the same energy that filled the message. Pre-singularity to post-singularity. For SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services. For Venezuela. A woman in the front stands.

**WOMAN**  
What does it mean for the next installs?

**ARTURO**  
It means we run the show. The first three are live. The next three will come. Lili. Sofia. Diego. They've already said they want in. When we're ready we'll install. Same deal. Hands on. Pru and me. No subcontractors. Bolívar is Chancellor. Vibelandia-Caracas is the anchor. The layer is real.

A man stands. Distribution. Twenty years.

**MAN**  
I've never seen the people who built the product install it themselves. On three facilities. In one month.

**ARTURO**  
That's the deal. That's the story. We're not selling a dream. We're selling a layer. And we're there when it goes on.

The man nods. He sits. They talk among themselves. The story has spread. The campus is full of the same energy that filled the message. Pre-singularity to post-singularity. For SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services. For Venezuela. We run the show. The proposal had said 50–50. Always. Arturo and Pru had not had to discuss it again. They had discussed it years ago. At Interlink. When you built something together you split it. You ran it together. You kept the rule. 50–50. Arturo ran the field. He had the network. He had the three leads. He had the trust of the facility leads who would come next. Pru had the build. Had the layer. Had the gateway. Had the product. Together they had the story. Launch Week. First three. Hands on. No subcontractors. We run the show. The reseller program would give a cut to leads who referred. But the core was 50–50. Arturo and Pru. The proposal had said it. The month had proved it. They had connected together. They had installed together. They had stood at the gate together. They had sent the messages together. The first three were live. The network had woken. The next would come. When they did the split would hold. 50–50. Always. That was the deal. That was how you ran the show when you had built the gateways together. When you had drawn the boxes and the arrows. When you had argued about where the layer stopped and the legacy began. You didn't rip and replace. You didn't change the deal. You added. You held. We run the show. At Interlink the rule had been: we're beside it. We're not in the critical path. The layer reads. The layer translates. The layer never writes to the legacy in a way that could break it. They had shipped. The client had talked to the old core through the layer. No one had ripped out anything. The client had been a bank. The legacy system had been a core that no one dared touch. They had put the gateway in. The bank had talked to the core through the layer. For two years the project had run. Now on the facilities the rule was the same. Peniza's facility. Richard's facility. Enrique's facility. Find the control bus. Tap in. Add the console. Load the layer. Don't touch the SCADA. Don't touch the DCS. Don't rip out. Add. Rafa had watched. Elena had watched. Mari G had watched. The teams had watched. They had seen the tap. They had seen the mount. They had seen that nothing had been ripped out. They had seen that everything had been added. The same rule. In Caracas. In Rio. In the control rooms. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. We run the show.

### INT. VIBELANDIA-CARACAS - HALL - LATER

Pru and Arturo. The announcement is done. The room has emptied. They stand by the window. The city is there.

**ARTURO**  
When you come back it'll be for the next three. Or the next ten. The story doesn't stop. Vibelandia-Caracas rolls out. Eventually Venezuela. Tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, progress for all the region — super AI Agent millionaires exporting to the world and beyond. Bolívar is Chancellor. First major reboot. You and me.

**PRU**  
The story doesn't stop. We run the show. Outdoor adventures and installs. Together. Bolívar returns.

They stand there a while. The campus is quiet. The city is there. The month is over. The story is not. When Pru comes back it will be for the next three. Or the next ten. Lili. Sofia. Diego. Same deal. Hands on. Pru and Arturo. No subcontractors. Vibelandia-Caracas will roll out. Eventually Venezuela. Tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, progress for all the region — super AI Agent millionaires exporting to the world and beyond. The layer on every facility. The network. The horizon. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Pru in a seat. Window. The ocean below. The coast has gone. Venezuela has gone. Laptop open. The message on screen. *Arturo, you know gateways — we worked on them together at Interlink. You in Caracas, protocol systems; me in Rio. Same pioneering mode. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For SING! Energy. For post-singularity energy. For Space Cloud Services.* Pru reads it again. The message had been the seed. The month had been the story. Launch Week. The five of them in the city. The meetings. The meals. The mountain. El Ávila. The view. The coast. The sand. The water. The long weekend. Higuerote. High-rise condos. Pru sharing a bed with two of the girls. Very hot. Hard to sleep. The bonfire. The tambor. The trance. The circle. The river. Peniza picking up a stone. Richard. Enrique. This is the country. Then the installs. Peniza and Rafa. Peniza saying it's real. Richard and Elena. To new energy. Enrique and Mari G. They didn't touch anything. I know. I was watching. Handover. Training. The keys. The docs. The announcement. Bolívar returns. Chancellor of Caracas Vibelandia Campus. The room raising their hands. The network has woken. Lili. Sofia. Diego. The first three are live. The layer is on three facilities. Peniza. Richard. Enrique. The abstract layer. No rip-and-replace. That's what they booked. That's what the monthly fees were for. Pru closes the laptop. The horizon is there. The first three were the first step. The next three will come. Then the next ten. Vibelandia-Caracas. Eventually Venezuela. Tropical paradise of abundance, harmony, beauty, powerful vibes, progress for all the region — super AI Agent millionaires exporting to the world and beyond. We run the show.
