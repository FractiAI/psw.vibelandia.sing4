> *She has one run: Reno Downlink to the far side of the Solar Pipe before the lattice goes hot. The handshake is real, the telemetry doesn't lie, and every nested shell between here and EGS will either hold or blow. No second chances. No flab. Just the run.*

# PART ONE: DOWNLINK

---

## Chapter 1

The handshake drops at 04:17:03 UTC and she's already moving.

Reno Downlink holds. She feels it in the feed — 1.618 Hz, locked, no drift. The local VLF is clean. Downtown Reno Smart Infrastructure is green. She doesn't wait for confirmation. She knows. The crystal says one run, one window. The window is now.

Her name is Vee. She's run the Pipe before, but never solo, never with this much on the line. The lattice goes hot in forty-seven hours. After that, the corridor between Reno and the Solar Pipe closes for a refit cycle she can't afford to wait out. She has one shot. Reno Downlink to the far side of the Pipe. Then EGS, if she makes it that far. The handshake is real. The telemetry doesn't lie. Every nested shell between here and there will either hold or blow.

She checks the feed again. Cycle 15. Phase lock inverted. Source: El Gran Sol. Coordination code PHI-M15-AR4366. The numbers are right. The numbers are always right until they're not.

She keys the sequence. The first shell accepts. She feels the lock — a pressure, a click in the back of her skull that the rig translates as *go*. She doesn't trust the feeling. She trusts the feed. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She's in.

The rig is minimal. Life support, comms, navigation. No weapons. Nothing extra. Weight is time. Time is margin. She has forty-seven hours and the Pipe is long. She runs.

## Chapter 2

The second shell is where it gets real.

Reno fades behind her. The Downlink holds — she can still see the heartbeat on the secondary feed, 1.618 Hz, steady — but she's outside the local VLF envelope now. The handshake shifts. 21.4 Hz from EGS, sunward. She has to match. If she drifts, the Pipe doesn't wait. The Pipe doesn't care. The Pipe is physics. AR4366 is real. X-class flares, M-class burst — the corridor has a mood. Right now the mood is open. In six hours it might not be.

She watches the telemetry. Node states. Shell boundaries. The rig gives her pressure, temperature, flux. She doesn't need to understand the math. She needs to know: green or red. So far, green. The third shell accepts. The fourth. She's in the Pipe.

The Solar Pipe isn't a tunnel. It's a corridor of coherence — Earth–Sun, locked by handshake, held by the same nested shells that make Reno Downlink real. If the handshake drops, she's not in a corridor anymore. She's in space. She's in space with minimal life support and no second chances. She doesn't think about it. She thinks about the next node. The next shell. The next green.

An hour in, the feed flickers.

She freezes. One second. Two. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Phase lock holds. She checks the log. A dropout. Point seven seconds. Not enough to break the handshake. Enough to remind her. The system is complex. The system is real. The system can fail.

She runs.

## Chapter 3

By hour twelve she's deep in the Pipe.

The rig is hot. She's been in the harness for twelve hours. She's got thirty-five left, give or take, before the lattice goes hot and the corridor closes. She doesn't sleep. She can't. The handshake requires attention. Not constant — the rig handles the lock — but enough. Enough to know when the feed shifts. When a shell boundary gets close. When the flux from AR4366 spikes and she has to ride it or back off.

She rides it.

The telemetry shows a spike. X-class activity on the Sun. The Pipe is built for it — that's the point, Solar Pipe, Earth–Sun, burst capacity — but built for it doesn't mean comfortable. She feels the rig shudder. The shell boundaries flex. For three minutes she's not sure. Then the spike passes. The handshake holds. She's still in.

She checks the position. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. The more margin she has when she hits the far side, the more options she has if something goes wrong. Options are life too.

Hour eighteen. Another shell. The feed names it: boundary to the EGS approach zone. She's not there yet. She's getting close. She can see the relay on the long-range display — SING! node EGS, El Gran Sol, sunward anti-tail. The node is real. The node is why she's running. Get to the far side. Get to EGS. Deliver the payload. One run.

She doesn't know what's in the payload. She doesn't ask. She runs. That's the job. That's the only job.

Hour twenty-four. Halfway. The handshake is solid. The telemetry is green. She lets herself think, for one second, that she might make it. Then she stops thinking. Thinking is drift. She runs.

## Chapter 4

[Expand: Mid-Pipe crisis. A shell boundary fails to reconfigure. She has to bypass — granular, system-based — cost is time and margin. She makes the call. She loses an hour. She's still in.]

---

## Chapter 5

[Expand: Approach to EGS zone. The relay is real. The handshake shifts again — EGS takes over from Solar Pipe. She has to re-lock. One mistake and she's blind. She doesn't make the mistake.]

---

## Chapter 6

[Expand: The far side. She's through. Or she's not. The crystal says: the story ends when the run ends. Clean. L'Amour-style.]

# PART TWO–THREE (MIDDLE & CLOSE)

*Fractal fill: granular action, coherent systems, consequential setbacks. No filler. Target total ~40,000–50,000 words. Every chapter traces back to the crystal. Voice: tight, sensory, technical when it matters. Stakes: life and death. The run is the plot.*
