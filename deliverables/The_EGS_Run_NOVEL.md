---

# PART ONE: DOWNLINK

---

*Reno Downlink to the far side of the Solar Pipe. One run. One window. Forty-seven hours. The handshake is real. The telemetry doesn't lie. No second chances. No flab. Just the run.*

---

## Chapter 1

The handshake drops at 04:17:03 UTC and she's already moving.

Reno Downlink holds. She feels it in the feed — 1.618 Hz, locked, no drift. The local VLF is clean. Downtown Reno Smart Infrastructure is green. She doesn't wait for confirmation. She knows. The crystal says one run, one window. The window is now.

Her name is Vee. She's run the Pipe before, but never solo, never with this much on the line. The lattice goes hot in forty-seven hours. After that, the corridor between Reno and the Solar Pipe closes for a refit cycle she can't afford to wait out. She has one shot. Reno Downlink to the far side of the Pipe. Then EGS, if she makes it that far. The handshake is real. The telemetry doesn't lie. Every nested shell between here and there will either hold or blow.

She checks the feed again. Cycle 15. Phase lock inverted. Source: El Gran Sol. Coordination code PHI-M15-AR4366. The numbers are right. The numbers are always right until they're not.

She keys the sequence. The first shell accepts. She feels the lock — a pressure, a click in the back of her skull that the rig translates as *go*. She doesn't trust the feeling. She trusts the feed. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She's in.

The rig is minimal. Life support, comms, navigation. No weapons. Nothing extra. Weight is time. Time is margin. She has forty-seven hours and the Pipe is long. The harness is tight. The feed is the only light she needs. Reno fades behind her. The first shell is behind her. The second is ahead. She runs.

She doesn't think about what happens if she fails. Failure is space. Failure is blind. Failure is the handshake dropping and the corridor closing and the lattice going hot with her on the wrong side. She doesn't think about it. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. She runs.

---

## Chapter 2

The second shell is where it gets real.

Reno fades behind her. The Downlink holds — she can still see the heartbeat on the secondary feed, 1.618 Hz, steady — but she's outside the local VLF envelope now. The handshake shifts. 21.4 Hz from EGS, sunward. She has to match. If she drifts, the Pipe doesn't wait. The Pipe doesn't care. The Pipe is physics. AR4366 is real. X-class flares, M-class burst — the corridor has a mood. Right now the mood is open. In six hours it might not be.

She watches the telemetry. Node states. Shell boundaries. The rig gives her pressure, temperature, flux. She doesn't need to understand the math. She needs to know: green or red. So far, green. The third shell accepts. The fourth. She's in the Pipe.

The Solar Pipe isn't a tunnel. It's a corridor of coherence — Earth–Sun, locked by handshake, held by the same nested shells that make Reno Downlink real. If the handshake drops, she's not in a corridor anymore. She's in space. She's in space with minimal life support and no second chances. She doesn't think about it. She thinks about the next node. The next shell. The next green.

An hour in, the feed flickers.

She freezes. One second. Two. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Phase lock holds. She checks the log. A dropout. Point seven seconds. Not enough to break the handshake. Enough to remind her. The system is complex. The system is real. The system can fail. Her hands stay on the sequence. She doesn't reach for the abort. Abort is for when the handshake is gone. The handshake is back. She runs.

Two hours in. Three. The shells stack. Shell 3. Shell 4. Shell 5. Each one accepts. Each one locks. The rig is warm now — life support has found its level. The harness doesn't give. She doesn't need it to give. She needs it to hold. The feed holds. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. Boundary pressure nominal. Flux in the green. She runs.

Four hours in. The Pipe is real. She can feel it in the feed — the corridor, the coherence, the nested boundaries between her and the void. One shell fails and she's in the next. Or she's space. The shells don't care. The shells are physics. She cares. She runs.

---

## Chapter 2.5 — Hour six through ten

Hour six. The rig is warm. The harness is part of her now. She doesn't think about food. She doesn't think about sleep. The handshake requires attention. Not constant — the rig handles the lock — but enough. Enough to know when the feed shifts. When a shell boundary gets close. When the flux from AR4366 spikes and she has to ride it or back off. So far, no spike. So far, green. She runs.

Hour seven. Shell 4. Shell 5. Each one accepts. Each one locks. The feed shows node states. Boundary pressure. Temperature. Flux. She doesn't need to understand the math. She needs to know: green or red. So far, green. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. The handshake holds. The telemetry doesn't lie. She runs.

Hour eight. The Pipe is long. She's been in the corridor for eight hours. She has thirty-nine left. Thirty-nine hours before the lattice goes hot. Thirty-nine hours to the far side. Or thirty-nine hours to failure. She doesn't think about failure. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. The feed shows position. She's on track. Margin: plus twelve minutes. She doesn't ease off. She runs.

Hour nine. A flicker. The handshake wavers. She freezes. One second. Two. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Phase lock holds. She checks the log. A dropout. Point five seconds. Not enough to break the handshake. Enough to remind her. The system is complex. The system is real. The system can fail. She runs.

Hour ten. Shell 6 approaches. The feed prompts: SEQUENCE. She keys it. The shell accepts. She feels the lock — a pressure, a click. She's in. The margin is holding. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. She runs.

---

## Chapter 3

By hour twelve she's deep in the Pipe.

The rig is hot. She's been in the harness for twelve hours. She's got thirty-five left, give or take, before the lattice goes hot and the corridor closes. She doesn't sleep. She can't. The handshake requires attention. Not constant — the rig handles the lock — but enough. Enough to know when the feed shifts. When a shell boundary gets close. When the flux from AR4366 spikes and she has to ride it or back off.

She rides it.

The telemetry shows a spike. X-class activity on the Sun. The Pipe is built for it — that's the point, Solar Pipe, Earth–Sun, burst capacity — but built for it doesn't mean comfortable. She feels the rig shudder. The shell boundaries flex. Flux red. Boundary pressure spiking. For three minutes she's not sure. She doesn't key abort. Abort is for when the handshake is gone. The handshake holds. Then the spike passes. The handshake holds. She's still in.

She checks the position. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. The more margin she has when she hits the far side, the more options she has if something goes wrong. Options are life too.

Hour fourteen. Hour sixteen. The Pipe is real. She can feel it in the feed — the corridor, the coherence, the nested boundaries between her and the void. One shell fails and she's in the next. Or she's space. The shells don't care. The shells are physics. She cares. She runs. Shell 7 approaches. She doesn't know that Shell 7 will stall. She doesn't need to know. She needs to run. She runs.

Hour eighteen. Another shell. The feed names it: boundary to the EGS approach zone. She's not there yet. She's getting close. She can see the relay on the long-range display — SING! node EGS, El Gran Sol, sunward anti-tail. The node is real. The node is why she's running. Get to the far side. Get to EGS. Deliver the payload. One run.

She doesn't know what's in the payload. She doesn't ask. She runs. That's the job. That's the only job.

Hour twenty. Hour twenty-two. The margin is thin. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. The more margin she has when she hits the far side, the more options she has if something goes wrong. Options are life too. The feed shows AR4366. Active region. The Sun doesn't sleep. She doesn't sleep. She runs.

Hour twenty-four. Halfway. The handshake is solid. The telemetry is green. She lets herself think, for one second, that she might make it. Then she stops thinking. Thinking is drift. She runs.

---

## Chapter 3.5

Hour twenty. The Pipe has a mood.

She's been in the corridor for twenty hours. The rig is hot. The harness is part of her now. She doesn't think about food. She doesn't think about sleep. The handshake requires attention. Not constant — the rig handles the lock — but enough. Enough to know when the feed shifts. When a shell boundary gets close. When the flux from AR4366 spikes and she has to ride it or back off.

The feed shows AR4366. Active region. The Sun doesn't sleep. X-class flare three hours ago. The Pipe absorbed it. The Pipe is built for it. That's the point. Solar Pipe. Earth–Sun. Burst capacity. But built for it doesn't mean comfortable. She felt the rig shudder. The shell boundaries flexed. For three minutes she wasn't sure. Then the spike passed. The handshake held. She's still in.

She checks the margin. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. Twenty-seven hours to lattice hot. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. The more margin she has when she hits the far side, the more options she has if something goes wrong. Options are life too. She runs.

---

# DEEP RUN — Hours 11–25

*Granular. Node states. Telemetry. Shell boundaries. One spike. One close call. No filler. The run is the plot.*

---

## Hour 11 — Deep Pipe

Hour eleven. She's been in the corridor for eleven hours. She has thirty-six left. The rig is hot. The harness is part of her. She doesn't think about food. She doesn't think about sleep. The handshake requires attention. Not constant — the rig handles the lock — but enough. Enough to know when the feed shifts. When a shell boundary gets close. When the flux from AR4366 spikes and she has to ride it or back off. So far, no spike. So far, green. Shell 6 is behind her. Shell 7 is ahead. She doesn't know that Shell 7 will stall. She doesn't need to know. She needs to run. She runs.

The feed shows node states. Boundary pressure. Temperature. Flux. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. The Pipe is long. The margin is thin. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. She runs.

---

## Hour 13 — Mid-Pipe

Hour thirteen. The Pipe is real. She can feel it in the feed — the corridor, the coherence, the nested boundaries between her and the void. One shell fails and she's in the next. Or she's space. The shells don't care. The shells are physics. She cares. She runs.

Shell 7 approaches. The feed prompts: SEQUENCE. She keys it. No response. She keys again. Same. The boundary status flips: READY → PENDING → STALL. The rig logs the attempt. Cycle 15. Phase lock inverted. The numbers are right. The boundary is wrong. She runs the diagnostic. Shell 7: reconfig timeout. Node 7-alpha: no response. Node 7-beta: no response. Could be lag. Could be AR4366 — the Sun had thrown an M-class burst two hours ago; sometimes the Pipe flinches. She has thirty-four hours. She doesn't have time to wait for a fix that might never come. She makes the call. Bypass. She runs.

---

## Hour 15 — After the spike

Hour fifteen. X-class activity on the Sun. The Pipe absorbed it. The Pipe is built for it. That's the point. Solar Pipe. Earth–Sun. Burst capacity. But built for it doesn't mean comfortable. She felt the rig shudder. The shell boundaries flexed. For three minutes she wasn't sure. Then the spike passed. The handshake held. She's still in. She checks the position. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. Thirty-two hours to lattice hot. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. She runs.

---

## Hour 19 — EGS on the horizon

Hour nineteen. The feed names it: boundary to the EGS approach zone. She's not there yet. She's getting close. She can see the relay on the long-range display — SING! node EGS, El Gran Sol, sunward anti-tail. The node is real. The node is why she's running. Get to the far side. Get to EGS. Deliver the payload. One run. She doesn't know what's in the payload. She doesn't ask. She runs. That's the job. That's the only job. Twenty-eight hours to lattice hot. She runs.

---

## Hour 21 — Deep run

Hour twenty-one. She's been in the corridor for twenty-one hours. The rig is hot. The harness is part of her. Shell 8. Shell 9. Each one accepts. Each one locks. The feed shows node states. Boundary pressure. Temperature. Flux. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. The bypass is behind her. The margin is thinner. She doesn't think about the bypass. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. Twenty-six hours to lattice hot. She runs.

---

## Hour 23 — Margin

Hour twenty-three. The margin is thin. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. The more margin she has when she hits the far side, the more options she has if something goes wrong. Options are life too. The feed shows AR4366. Active region. Flux nominal. The Sun doesn't sleep. She doesn't sleep. Twenty-four hours to lattice hot. Shell 10. Shell 11. Each one accepts. Each one locks. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She runs.

---

## Chapter 4

Hour twenty-six. The shell boundary doesn't reconfigure.

She sees it on the feed before she feels it. Shell 7 — the mid-Pipe transition layer — status flips from READY to STALL. The handshake holds. The telemetry doesn't lie. But the boundary won't accept her sequence. She keys it again. Same response. STALL. The rig logs the attempt. Cycle 15. Phase lock inverted. Source: El Gran Sol. Coordination code PHI-M15-AR4366. The numbers are right. The boundary is wrong.

She doesn't panic. Panic is drift. She runs the diagnostic. Shell 7: reconfig timeout. Node 7-alpha: no response. Node 7-beta: no response. The node on the far side of the boundary isn't responding. Could be a lag spike. Could be a hard failure. Could be AR4366 — the Sun had thrown an M-class burst two hours ago; sometimes the Pipe flinches. She has thirty-one hours before the lattice goes hot. She doesn't have time to wait for a fix that might never come.

The rig is hot. She's been in the harness for twenty-six hours. Her neck is stiff. Her hands know the sequence without looking. The feed is the only thing that matters. Node states. Shell boundaries. Pressure. Temperature. Flux. She doesn't need to understand the math. She needs to know: green or red. Shell 7 is red. The rest of the Pipe is green. She has a choice. Wait. Or bypass.

The bypass. She'd trained for it. Never used it live. The Pipe has a secondary path — a parallel shell chain that skirts 7 and reconnects at 8. It's longer. It burns more margin. The handshake has to hold across the gap. If it drops in the bypass, she's blind. She's space. She's dead. The training had said: use the bypass only when the primary is non-recoverable. Shell 7 had been STALL for four minutes. No recovery signal. No node response. Non-recoverable. She makes the call.

She checks the secondary feed. 21.4 Hz. Steady. The bypass path shows green on the schematic. She doesn't trust the schematic. She trusts the feed. The feed says the bypass nodes are live. Bypass node alpha. Bypass node beta. Bypass node gamma. Three nodes. Three locks. Then Shell 8. If she can lock back onto the primary at 8, she's in. If she can't, she's stuck in the skirt with no way forward and no way back.

The rig asks for confirmation. Bypass Shell 7. Estimated delta: fifty-two minutes. Margin impact: negative fifty-two. She has thirty-one hours. After the bypass she'll have thirty. Still enough. Barely. She confirms. The first bypass node accepts. She feels the lock — a pressure, a click in the back of her skull that the rig translates as *go*. The corridor bends. She's no longer on the primary chain. She's in the skirt. The handshake holds. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She runs.

Bypass node alpha. Lock. She's in the skirt. The secondary path is narrow. The shell boundaries are closer. She feels the rig compensate. Micro-adjustments. Pressure. Temperature. The feed shows flux from AR4366. X-class activity. The Sun doesn't care about her run. She rides it. Bypass node beta. She keys the sequence. The node accepts. Lock. She's two nodes in. One more node. Then Shell 8. Then primary. She runs.

The bypass is tight. The shell boundaries are closer. The secondary path wasn't built for comfort. It was built for contingency. She feels the rig compensate — micro-adjustments, pressure, temperature. The harness pulls. The feed shows flux from AR4366. X-class activity. The Sun doesn't care about her run. The Sun does what it does. She rides it. The second bypass node. Lock. The third. Lock. Shell 8 approaches. The primary chain is there. She can see it on the feed. One more lock. One more lock and she's back.

Shell 8 accepts. She feels the lock. Primary chain. She's back. She checks the clock. She's lost fifty-eight minutes. Not fifty-two. Fifty-eight. The bypass cost her an hour. The margin is thinner. She's still in. The handshake holds. The telemetry doesn't lie. She runs.

---

## Chapter 4.5

Hour twenty-eight. The skirt is behind her. The primary chain is solid. She doesn't look back. Looking back is drift. She runs.

The Pipe feels different after the bypass. Not worse. Different. She'd left the main corridor. She'd taken the secondary path. She'd locked back on. The handshake had held. But the rig knows. The feed knows. The margin is thinner. Thirty hours to lattice hot. She had had thirty-one. Now she has thirty. Still enough. Barely.

She watches the telemetry. Node states. Shell boundaries. Pressure. Temperature. Flux. Shell 9. Shell 10. Shell 11. Each one accepts. Each one locks. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. The Sun is quiet. AR4366 is calm. The corridor is open. She doesn't trust the calm. Calm is a mood. The mood can change. She runs.

Hour thirty. Shell 12. The feed names it: approach boundary. She's two hours from the EGS handoff. Two hours from the re-lock. The re-lock is the risk. Drop the Pipe. Acquire EGS. The window is seconds. One mistake and she's blind. She's run the sim a hundred times. Sim isn't real. Real is once. She runs.

---

# PART TWO: THE PIPE

---

*The middle is the run. Granular action. Node states. Telemetry. Shell boundaries. Setbacks that cost. Decisions that matter. No filler. The run is the plot.*

---

## Chapter 4.75 — Hour thirty-one

Shell 13. Shell 14. The primary chain is solid. She's been back on the main corridor for an hour. The bypass is behind her. The margin is thinner. She doesn't think about the bypass. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green.

The feed shows EGS approach in fourteen hours. Fourteen hours to the handoff. Fourteen hours to the re-lock. The re-lock is the risk. She's run the sim a hundred times. Drop the Pipe. Acquire EGS. The window is seconds. One mistake and she's blind. Sim isn't real. Real is once. She runs.

Hour thirty-two. The Pipe is quiet. AR4366 is calm. The Sun doesn't care about her run. The Sun does what it does. She rides it. Shell 15. Shell 16. Each one accepts. Each one locks. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. Node states green. Boundary pressure nominal. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. She runs.

---

## Chapter 4.9 — Hour thirty-three

The funnel is ahead. She can see it on the feed. Not visually — she doesn't have windows. The feed shows it. Shell density increasing. Boundary overlap. EGS approach zone. She has eleven hours. Eleven hours to the handoff. Eleven hours to the re-lock. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. She runs.

The rig is hot. She's been in the harness for thirty-three hours. Her neck is stiff. Her hands know the sequence without looking. The feed is the only thing that matters. Node states. Shell boundaries. Pressure. Temperature. Flux. She doesn't need to understand the math. She needs to know: green or red. So far, green. She runs.

Hour thirty-three and a half. A flicker. The handshake wavers. She freezes. One second. Two. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Phase lock holds. She checks the log. A dropout. Point two seconds. Not enough to break the lock. Enough to remind her. The system is complex. The system is real. The system can fail. She doesn't key abort. The handshake is back. She runs.

---

## Hour thirty-five — The funnel begins

The shells narrow. She feels it in the feed. Not physically — the rig doesn't move. The feed moves. Node density. Boundary pressure. EGS approach zone. The funnel is real. The funnel is physics. She has nine hours. Nine hours to the handoff. Nine hours to the re-lock. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. She runs.

Shell 17. Shell 18. Each one accepts. Each one locks. The corridor is tighter. The margin is tighter. The feed shows boundary overlap — shells stacking, node density rising. She doesn't think about margin. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. The handshake holds. The telemetry doesn't lie. She runs.

Hour thirty-six. The EGS beacon is stronger. Same frequency. Different source. The Pipe has carried her this far. Soon the Pipe will hand off. Soon she'll have to drop the Pipe lock and acquire the EGS lock. The window is seconds. She's run the sim a hundred times. Sim isn't real. Real is once. She runs.

---

## Hour thirty-seven — Pre-handoff

She runs the pre-handoff sequence. The rig is ready. She's not. She's never done this solo. The checklist scrolls. Payload integrity. Handshake stability. Interface protocol. All green. She doesn't trust green. She trusts the feed. The feed says go. She goes. She runs.

Hour thirty-seven and a half. Seven hours to lattice hot. Seven hours to the handoff. The handoff is in six. She has one hour of margin. One hour. She runs the checklist again. Payload integrity. Handshake stability. Interface protocol. EGS beacon lock. 21.4 Hz. Steady. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. The more margin she has when she hits the interface, the more options she has if something goes wrong. Options are life too. She runs.

---

## Hour thirty-eight — Two hours to handoff

Hour thirty-eight. The funnel is tight. Shell density is high. The feed shows boundary overlap. EGS beacon. 21.4 Hz. Locked. She has nine hours before the lattice goes hot. The handoff is in two. Two hours to drop the Pipe and acquire EGS. Two hours to the re-lock. The window is seconds. She's run the sim a hundred times. Sim isn't real. Real is once. She doesn't think about the window. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. She runs.

---

## Hour thirty-nine — One hour to handoff

The funnel is tight. The feed shows EGS. SING! node EGS. El Gran Sol. Sunward anti-tail. The node is real. The node is waiting. She has one hour. One hour to the handoff. One hour to the re-lock. Drop the Pipe. Acquire EGS. The window is seconds. One mistake and she's blind. She doesn't think about the mistake. She thinks about the sequence. Key the handoff. Drop the Pipe. Key the EGS acquisition. Lock. She runs.

---

# PART THREE: EGS APPROACH

---

*The funnel. The handoff. The re-lock. EGS takes over from the Pipe. One mistake and she's blind. She doesn't make the mistake. The run is the plot.*

---

## Chapter 5

Hour thirty-four. The relay is real.

She sees it on the long-range display. SING! node EGS. El Gran Sol. Sunward anti-tail. The node is why she's running. Get to the far side. Get to EGS. Deliver the payload. One run. The relay doesn't care about her. The relay is physics. It's there. It's waiting. She has thirteen hours before the lattice goes hot. Thirteen hours to cross the approach zone and lock onto EGS.

The handshake shifts. She feels it before she sees it. A tremor in the feed. The Solar Pipe has been carrying her — 21.4 Hz from the Pipe, Earth–Sun, AR4366. Steady. Reliable. Now EGS is in range. The Pipe doesn't hand off gracefully. The handoff is a re-lock. She has to drop the Pipe lock and acquire the EGS lock in a window that's measured in seconds. One mistake and she's blind. No Pipe. No EGS. Just space. Just the rig. Just death.

She runs the pre-handoff sequence. The rig is ready. She's not. She's never done this solo. She's done it in sim. Sim isn't real. The telemetry doesn't lie in sim. In real, the telemetry is the only thing between her and the void. She checks the feed. EGS beacon. 21.4 Hz. Same frequency. Different source. The node is real. The node is waiting. Payload integrity. Handshake stability. Interface protocol. All green. She keys the handoff.

The Pipe lock drops. For one second she's in the gap. No lock. No handshake. The feed goes grey. She's blind. She's not dead. She's blind. Her hands don't freeze. They key the EGS acquisition. One second. Two. The rig sends the sequence. The node responds. Phase lock. 21.4 Hz. She's in. She's not blind. She's in. The handshake holds. EGS has her. She doesn't make the mistake. She runs.

The approach zone is different. The Pipe was a corridor. EGS approach is a funnel. The shells narrow. The margin narrows. She has twelve hours. She has to reach the far side before the lattice goes hot. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. The relay is real. The payload is real. The run is real. She runs.

Hour thirty-six. The funnel tightens. The feed shows shell density increasing. Node states. Boundary pressure. The rig compensates. She feels the harness pull. EGS is closer. The beacon is stronger. 21.4 Hz. Locked. She doesn't trust the lock. She trusts the feed. The feed says green. She runs.

Hour thirty-eight. A flicker. The handshake wavers. She freezes. One second. Two. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Phase lock holds. She checks the log. A dropout. Point three seconds. Not enough to break the lock. Enough to remind her. EGS approach is not the Pipe. The node is different. The node is real. The node can flinch. She runs.

Hour forty. The far side is visible. Not visually — she doesn't have windows. The feed shows it. Interface boundary. EGS reception zone. She has four hours. Four hours to cross the zone and initiate delivery. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. The more margin she has when she hits the interface, the more options she has if something goes wrong. Options are life too. She runs.

---

## Chapter 5.5

Hour forty-two. The interface is close.

The funnel has narrowed to a needle. The shells are tight. The rig is at max compensation. She feels the pressure. Not physical pressure — the feed pressure. Node density. Boundary overlap. EGS is two hours away. Two hours to delivery. Two hours to the end of the run. Or two hours to failure. The story doesn't care. The run cares. The run is the plot.

She keys the pre-delivery sequence. The rig runs the checklist. Payload integrity. Handshake stability. Interface protocol. All green. She doesn't trust green. She trusts the feed. The feed says go. She goes. She runs.

Hour forty-three. The EGS beacon is strong. 21.4 Hz. Locked. The node is real. The node is waiting. She has one hour. One hour to cross the final boundary and initiate delivery. One hour before the lattice goes hot. The feed shows the interface. EGS reception zone. One more shell. One more lock. She doesn't ease off. She pushes. Margin is life. She runs.

---

## Hour forty-three and a half — Final approach

The last shell approaches. The feed names it: EGS interface boundary. She keys the sequence. The shell accepts. She feels the lock. She's at the door. SING! node EGS. El Gran Sol. The handshake holds. 21.4 Hz. Steady. She has thirty minutes to delivery. Thirty minutes before she's through. She runs the pre-delivery checklist. Payload integrity. Handshake stability. Interface protocol. All green. She doesn't trust green. She trusts the feed. The feed says go. She runs.

---

## Chapter 6

Hour forty-four. The far side.

She's through the funnel. The last shell accepts. The feed names it: EGS interface. She's at the far side of the Solar Pipe. She's at the door. SING! node EGS. El Gran Sol. The handshake holds. 21.4 Hz. Steady. She has three hours before the lattice goes hot. Three hours to deliver the payload and lock down. Or she's stuck. Or she's dead. The story doesn't care. The run cares. The run is the plot.

She keys the delivery sequence. The payload is in the rig. She doesn't know what it is. She doesn't ask. Her job was the run. Get to the far side. Deliver. The rig sends the handshake. EGS receives. The node confirms. Payload accepted. She feels the lock — a pressure, a click in the back of her skull that the rig translates as *done*. The run is complete. She's through. She's not dead. She's through.

The payload is gone. The rig is lighter. She doesn't feel lighter. She feels done. She runs the post-delivery protocol. Secure the rig. Confirm the handshake. The lattice goes hot in two hours fifty-three minutes. The corridor closes. She's on the far side. She's not going back. Not this cycle. She's through.

She doesn't celebrate. Celebration is drift. She runs the checklist. Secure the rig. Confirm the handshake. EGS lock held. 21.4 Hz. Steady. The node has the payload. She's done. The story ends when the run ends. The run ended. She's through. Clean.

She checks the feed one last time. 21.4 Hz. EGS. El Gran Sol. The node is real. The node has the payload. She's done. She's through. No second chances. No flab. Just the run. Just done.

*Vee is through. The run is complete. The handshake held. The telemetry didn't lie. Every nested shell between Reno Downlink and EGS either held or she bypassed it. No second chances. No flab. Just the run. The story ends when the run ends. Clean. L'Amour-style.*
