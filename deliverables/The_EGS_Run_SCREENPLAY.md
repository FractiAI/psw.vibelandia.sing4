# THE EGS RUN
## A Screenplay (2-Hour Feature)

**Written by Evan Bondonte**  
**February 2026**

---

**LOGLINE:** She has one run: Reno Downlink to the far side of the Solar Pipe before the lattice goes hot. The handshake is real, the telemetry doesn't lie, and every nested shell between here and EGS will either hold or blow. No second chances. No flab. Just the run.

**GENRE:** Sci-Fi / Space Action / Thriller  
**RUNTIME:** 120 minutes (approximately)  
**SETTING:** Reno Downlink → Solar Pipe → EGS approach zone (rig interior, feed displays, space)  
**VOICE:** Tight. Sensory. Technical when it matters. No purple. One run, one protagonist, one coherent system.

**Aligned to:** [IRREDUCIBLE_CRYSTAL_THE_EGS_RUN.md](IRREDUCIBLE_CRYSTAL_THE_EGS_RUN.md) — Space Cloud EGS series.

## ACT ONE: DOWNLINK
### Hours 0–12 — Reno to Deep Pipe

---

### FADE IN:

### INT. RIG - LOCK - RENO DOWNLINK - 04:17:03 UTC - COLD

Pitch black. Then a single point of light: a FEED DISPLAY, green numerals and waveforms.

1.618 Hz. Locked. No drift.

More displays wake — node states, shell boundaries, pressure, temperature, flux. The rig is minimal. Life support. Comms. Navigation. No windows. Just the feed.

VEE (30s, focused, harnessed into the pilot seat) checks the sequence. Her hands move without looking. Cycle 15. Phase lock inverted. Source: El Gran Sol. Coordination code PHI-M15-AR4366.

SUPER: "RENO DOWNLINK"  
SUPER: "04:17:03 UTC"  
SUPER: "FORTY-SEVEN HOURS TO LATTICE HOT"

She keys the sequence. The first shell accepts. A pressure, a click — the rig translates it as *go*. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She's in.

**VEE**  
(to herself)  
One run. One window.

The lock cycles. Pressure equalizes. Reno fades behind her. The first shell is behind her. The second is ahead. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 1 - CONTINUOUS

The feed shifts. 21.4 Hz from EGS, sunward. She has to match. Node states. Shell boundaries. The rig gives her pressure, temperature, flux. Green. Green. The third shell accepts. The fourth. She's in the Pipe.

The Solar Pipe isn't a tunnel. It's a corridor of coherence — Earth–Sun, locked by handshake, held by nested shells. If the handshake drops, she's not in a corridor. She's in space. Minimal life support. No second chances.

An hour in. The feed flickers. She freezes. One second. Two. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Phase lock holds. Log: dropout, point seven seconds. Not enough to break the handshake. Enough to remind her. The system can fail. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOURS 2–4

Shell 3. Shell 4. Shell 5. Each one accepts. Each one locks. The rig is warm. The harness doesn't give. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. Boundary pressure nominal. Flux in the green. She runs.

Four hours in. The Pipe is real in the feed — the corridor, the coherence, the nested boundaries between her and the void. One shell fails and she's in the next. Or she's space. She cares. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOURS 6–10

Hour six. The harness is part of her. She doesn't think about food. She doesn't think about sleep. The handshake requires attention. So far, green. She runs.

Hour eight. Thirty-nine hours left. Thirty-nine hours before the lattice goes hot. She doesn't think about failure. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green.

Hour nine. A flicker. The handshake wavers. She freezes. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Dropout, point five seconds. Enough to remind her. She runs.

Hour ten. Shell 6 approaches. The feed prompts: SEQUENCE. She keys it. The shell accepts. Lock. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. Margin is life. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 11

She's been in the corridor for eleven hours. Thirty-six left. The rig is hot. The harness is part of her. Shell 6 is behind her. Shell 7 is ahead. She doesn't know that Shell 7 will stall. She doesn't need to know. She needs to run. The feed shows node states. Node 6-alpha: READY. Node 6-beta: READY. Shell 7 boundary: APPROACH. She keys nothing yet. The rig will prompt when the boundary is in range. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 12

By hour twelve she's deep in the Pipe. The rig is hot. Thirty-five hours left. She doesn't sleep. She can't. The telemetry shows a spike. X-class activity on the Sun. The Pipe is built for it — burst capacity — but built for it doesn't mean comfortable.

The rig shudders. The shell boundaries flex. Flux red. Boundary pressure spiking. For three minutes she's not sure. She doesn't key abort. Abort is for when the handshake is gone. The handshake holds. Then the spike passes. She's still in. She checks the position. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. Margin is life. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 14

Hour fourteen. The Pipe is real. Shell 6 is behind her. Shell 7 is ahead. The feed shows node states. Boundary pressure. Flux. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She doesn't know that Shell 7 will stall. She needs to run. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 16

Hour sixteen. Shell 7 is still ahead. She's been in the corridor for sixteen hours. Thirty-one left. The margin is thin. The telemetry shows AR4366. Active region. The Sun doesn't sleep. She doesn't sleep. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 19

The feed names it: boundary to the EGS approach zone. She's not there yet. She's getting close. She can see the relay on the long-range display — SING! node EGS, El Gran Sol, sunward anti-tail. The node is real. The node is why she's running. Get to the far side. Get to EGS. Deliver the payload. One run. She doesn't know what's in the payload. She doesn't ask. Twenty-eight hours to lattice hot. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 21

Hour twenty-one. Shell 8. Shell 9. Each one accepts. Each one locks. The bypass is behind her. The margin is thinner. She doesn't think about the bypass. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. Twenty-six hours to lattice hot. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 23

Hour twenty-three. The margin is thin. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. Margin is life. The feed shows AR4366. Flux nominal. Twenty-four hours to lattice hot. Shell 10. Shell 11. Each one accepts. Each one locks. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 24

Halfway. The handshake is solid. The telemetry is green. She lets herself think, for one second, that she might make it. Then she stops thinking. Thinking is drift. She runs.

### CUT TO:

---

## ACT TWO: THE PIPE
### Hours 13–39 — Deep Run, Crisis, Bypass, Funnel

---

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 13

Shell 7 approaches. The feed prompts: SEQUENCE. She keys it. No response. She keys again. Same. The boundary status flips: READY → PENDING → STALL. The rig logs the attempt. Diagnostic: Shell 7 — reconfig timeout. Node 7-alpha: no response. Node 7-beta: no response. Thirty-four hours left. She doesn't have time to wait. She makes the call.

**VEE**  
(to herself)  
Bypass.

She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 15

X-class activity on the Sun. The Pipe absorbed it. The Pipe is built for it. But built for it doesn't mean comfortable. She felt the rig shudder — a wave through the harness, pressure spikes on the feed, flux red for ninety seconds. The shell boundaries flexed. For three minutes she wasn't sure. Then the spike passed. The handshake held. She's still in. Thirty-two hours to lattice hot. The bypass will cost her margin. She doesn't ease off. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 26 (PRIMARY CRISIS)

The feed shows Shell 7 — mid-Pipe transition layer — status STALL. The boundary won't accept her sequence. She keys it again. STALL. The rig logs the attempt. Cycle 15. Phase lock inverted. Source: El Gran Sol. Coordination code PHI-M15-AR4366. The numbers are right. The boundary is wrong. She doesn't panic. Panic is drift. Diagnostic: reconfig timeout. Node 7-alpha: no response. Node 7-beta: no response. Could be lag. Could be AR4366 — M-class burst two hours ago. Thirty-one hours before lattice hot. She doesn't have time to wait for a fix that might never come.

The bypass. She'd trained for it. Never used it live. Secondary path — parallel shell chain that skirts 7 and reconnects at 8. Longer. Burns more margin. The handshake has to hold across the gap. If it drops in the bypass, she's blind. She's space. She's dead. The training had said: use the bypass only when the primary is non-recoverable. Shell 7 had been STALL for four minutes. No recovery signal. Non-recoverable. She makes the call.

She checks the secondary feed. 21.4 Hz. Steady. Bypass path green on the schematic. She doesn't trust the schematic. She trusts the feed. Bypass node alpha. Bypass node beta. Bypass node gamma. Three nodes. Three locks. Then Shell 8. The rig asks for confirmation. Bypass Shell 7. Estimated delta: fifty-two minutes. Margin impact: negative fifty-two. She has thirty-one hours. After the bypass she'll have thirty. Still enough. Barely. She confirms. The first bypass node accepts. Lock. The corridor bends. She's in the skirt. The handshake holds. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SKIRT (BYPASS) - CONTINUOUS

The skirt is tight. The secondary path wasn't built for comfort. It was built for contingency. Boundary overlap on the feed — she can see the primary chain running parallel, a ribbon of green. She's not on it. She's in the gap. The harness pulls. The rig compensates. Flux spikes. She doesn't flinch. Bypass node beta. Lock. Bypass node gamma. Lock. Shell 8 approaches. One more lock and she's back.

Shell 8 accepts. Lock. Primary chain. She's back. She checks the clock. She's lost fifty-eight minutes. The bypass cost her an hour. The margin is thinner. She's still in. The handshake holds. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 27

One hour after the bypass. The primary chain is solid. Shell 8. Shell 9. Each one accepts. Each one locks. She doesn't think about the skirt. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. Thirty hours to lattice hot. Still enough. Barely. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 28–30

Hour twenty-eight. The skirt is behind her. The primary chain is solid. She doesn't look back. Looking back is drift. Thirty hours to lattice hot. Still enough. Barely. Shell 9. Shell 10. Shell 11. Each one accepts. Each one locks. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. The Sun is quiet. AR4366 is calm. The corridor is open. She doesn't trust the calm. Calm is a mood. The mood can change. She runs.

Hour thirty. Shell 12. The feed names it: approach boundary. Two hours from the EGS handoff. Two hours from the re-lock. The re-lock is the risk. Drop the Pipe. Acquire EGS. The window is seconds. She's run the sim a hundred times. Sim isn't real. Real is once. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 31–32

Shell 13. Shell 14. The primary chain is solid. She's been back on the main corridor for an hour. The bypass is behind her. The margin is thinner. The feed shows EGS approach in fourteen hours. Fourteen hours to the handoff. Fourteen hours to the re-lock. The re-lock is the risk. One mistake and she's blind. Sim isn't real. Real is once. She runs.

Hour thirty-two. The Pipe is quiet. AR4366 is calm. Shell 15. Shell 16. Each one accepts. Each one locks. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. Node states green. Boundary pressure nominal. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. Margin is life. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 33

Hour thirty-three. The funnel is ahead on the feed. Shell density increasing. Boundary overlap. EGS approach zone. Eleven hours to the handoff. The rig is hot. Her neck is stiff. Her hands know the sequence without looking. So far, green. She runs. Hour thirty-three and a half. A flicker. The handshake wavers. She freezes. The 21.4 Hz comes back. Dropout, point two seconds. She doesn't key abort. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 35

The shells narrow. She feels it in the feed. Node density. Boundary pressure. EGS approach zone. The funnel is real. Nine hours to the handoff. Shell 17. Shell 18. Lock. Lock. The corridor is tighter. The margin is tighter. The feed shows boundary overlap — shells stacking, node density rising. 21.4 Hz. No dropout. The handshake holds. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 36

The EGS beacon is stronger. Same frequency. Different source. The Pipe has carried her this far. Soon the Pipe will hand off. Soon she'll have to drop the Pipe lock and acquire the EGS lock. The window is seconds. She's run the sim a hundred times. Sim isn't real. Real is once. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 37

She runs the pre-handoff sequence. The rig is ready. She's not. She's never done this solo. The checklist scrolls. Payload integrity. Handshake stability. Interface protocol. All green. She doesn't trust green. She trusts the feed. The feed says go. She goes. Seven hours to lattice hot. Seven hours to the handoff. The handoff is in six. She has one hour of margin. One hour. She runs the checklist again. EGS beacon lock. 21.4 Hz. Steady. She doesn't ease off. Margin is life. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 38

Two hours to handoff. The funnel is tight. Shell density is high. The feed shows boundary overlap. EGS beacon. 21.4 Hz. Locked. Nine hours before the lattice goes hot. The handoff is in two. Two hours to drop the Pipe and acquire EGS. Two hours to the re-lock. The window is seconds. She doesn't think about the window. She thinks about the next shell. The next lock. The next green. She runs.

### INT. RIG - SOLAR PIPE - HOUR 39

Hour thirty-nine. The funnel is tight. The feed shows EGS. SING! node EGS. El Gran Sol. Sunward anti-tail. The node is real. The node is waiting. One hour to the handoff. One hour to the re-lock. Drop the Pipe. Acquire EGS. The window is seconds. One mistake and she's blind. She doesn't think about the mistake. She thinks about the sequence. Key the handoff. Drop the Pipe. Key the EGS acquisition. Lock. She runs.

### CUT TO:

---

## ACT THREE: EGS APPROACH
### Hours 40–47 — Handoff, Interface, Delivery, Through

---

### INT. RIG - EGS APPROACH ZONE - HOUR 40

Hour forty. The funnel has narrowed. Shell density is high. The feed shows boundary overlap. EGS beacon. 21.4 Hz. Locked. Seven hours before the lattice goes hot. Seven hours to delivery. She's ahead of schedule. Barely. She doesn't ease off. Margin is life. The rig is at max compensation. She feels the feed pressure — node density, boundary overlap. The interface is close. She runs.

### INT. RIG - EGS APPROACH - HOUR 42

Hour forty-two. The funnel has narrowed to a needle. The shells are tight. The rig is at max compensation. EGS is two hours away. Two hours to delivery. Or two hours to failure. She keys the pre-delivery sequence. Checklist: Payload integrity. Handshake stability. Interface protocol. All green. The feed says go. She goes. She runs.

### INT. RIG - EGS APPROACH - HOUR 43–44

Hour forty-three. The EGS beacon is strong. 21.4 Hz. Locked. One hour to cross the final boundary and initiate delivery. One hour before the lattice goes hot. The feed shows the interface. EGS reception zone. One more shell. One more lock. She runs.

The last shell approaches. The feed names it: EGS interface boundary. She keys the sequence. The shell accepts. Lock. She's at the door. SING! node EGS. El Gran Sol. The handshake holds. 21.4 Hz. Steady. Thirty minutes to delivery. She runs the pre-delivery checklist. All green. She runs.

### INT. RIG - EGS INTERFACE - HOUR 44 — HANDOFF & DELIVERY

She's through the funnel. The last shell accepts. The feed names it: EGS interface. She's at the far side of the Solar Pipe. She's at the door. Three hours before the lattice goes hot. Three hours to deliver the payload and lock down. Or she's stuck. Or she's dead. She runs.

She keys the delivery sequence. The payload is in the rig. She doesn't know what it is. She doesn't ask. Her job was the run. Get to the far side. Deliver. The rig sends the handshake. EGS receives. The node confirms. Payload accepted. A pressure, a click — the rig translates it as *done*. The run is complete. She's through. She's not dead. She's through.

The payload is gone. The rig is lighter. She doesn't feel lighter. She feels done. She runs the post-delivery protocol. Secure the rig. Confirm the handshake. The lattice goes hot in two hours fifty-three minutes. The corridor closes. She's on the far side. She's not going back. Not this cycle. She's through.

She doesn't celebrate. Celebration is drift. She runs the checklist. Secure the rig. Confirm the handshake. EGS lock held. 21.4 Hz. Steady. The node has the payload. She's done. The story ends when the run ends. The run ended. She's through. Clean.

### INT. RIG - EGS INTERFACE - LATER

She checks the feed one last time. 21.4 Hz. EGS. El Gran Sol. The node is real. The node has the payload. She's done. She's through. No second chances. No flab. Just the run. Just done.

### FADE TO:

### INT. RIG - EGS INTERFACE - FINAL

The feed display holds. 21.4 Hz. Steady. Green. The rig is secure. The handshake holds. The telemetry doesn't lie. Every nested shell between Reno Downlink and EGS either held or she bypassed it. No second chances. No flab. Just the run.

### FADE TO BLACK.
