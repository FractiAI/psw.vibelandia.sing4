## Chapter 1: The Low Tide That Never Came Back

Monday morning arrived in downtown Reno like a whisper of something long forgotten, a memory of a tide that had gone out and never bothered to return. The streets lay exposed, barnacled and bare, showing all the things that had once lived beneath the waterline but now sat lifeless in the pale winter sun. Empty shells. Some still clinging to life, yes, but most — most had given up the ghost long ago.

If you stood on Virginia Street and looked north toward the old casinos, you could see it plain as day: the high-water marks on the buildings, the faded paint where neon signs had once blazed, the boarded windows that stared out like the eyes of men who had seen too much and decided to close them for good. Not total collapse, mind you. There were still a few souls shuffling about, still a few lights burning in the windows of the Reno Men's Club, still the faint smell of coffee and bacon drifting from the all-night diners. But the tide had gone out, and it had taken with it something essential, something that made a place feel alive rather than merely inhabited.

Get away, the old-timers would say. Get away while you still can.

Evan Bondonte had heard that phrase more times than he could count. He had come to Reno five years ago, drawn by something he couldn't quite name — a feeling that this place, this low tide that had never come back, was where something important would happen. He had worked odd jobs, tended bar, swept floors, done whatever it took to keep the Reno Men's Club open when everyone else had given up. Walt had run the place before him, a good man, a steady hand, but Walt had grown tired. The low tide had worn him down. And now Walt had stepped aside, and Evan had stepped up, and the club — that fine gentlemen's establishment with its full restaurant and cabaret, though you wouldn't know it from the outside — had become his charge, his burden, his hope.

He had believed, against all evidence, that the tide would turn. He had believed that downtown Reno, with its empty shells and barnacles and faded paint, would someday become something again. He had believed in the possibility of a flood.

And now, on this particular Monday morning, something was different.

There was a charge in the air, a crackle of electricity that hadn't been there the day before. The few people on the street moved with a little more purpose, looked up at the sky a little more often, as if expecting something to fall from it — or perhaps to rise from the empty shells and barnacles that littered the downtown landscape. Evan had felt it the moment he woke. He had felt it in his bones, in his blood, in the very air he breathed. Something was coming. Something was about to change.

He had dressed carefully that morning — his best shirt, his only tie, the shoes he reserved for occasions that mattered. He had stood in the men's restroom of the Reno Men's Club, that ground zero of ground zeros, and looked at himself in the mirror. He was neither young nor old, neither handsome nor plain. He was forty-two. He had seen things. He had done things. He had been places that most men only dream about, though he rarely spoke of them. His eyes held a particular light — the kind that comes from standing at the hinge of history and knowing it, from believing in something when everyone else has stopped believing.

"He's here," Evan said to his reflection, though whether he was speaking to himself or to someone else was unclear. "Howard Hughes is here."

The name hung in the air like smoke from a fine cigar, rich and complex and impossible to ignore.

Howard Hughes. The aviator. The filmmaker. The industrialist. The recluse. The legend. The man who had built empires and flown faster than sound and disappeared from public view for decades, only to emerge again when the world least expected him. Evan had received the call three days ago — a voice on the line, calm and certain, saying that Howard Hughes would be arriving Monday morning. That he had taken an interest in downtown Reno. That he had taken an interest in the Reno Men's Club. That he wanted to meet the man who had kept the doors open when everyone else had walked away.

"And I'm working for him now," Evan continued, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "We're gonna do this right. Walt's been doing a good job, sure. Walt kept the lights on. Walt kept the doors open. But it's time for Howard. Time for the real show to begin."

He straightened his tie one last time. The restroom was old but clean — black and white tile, porcelain fixtures, a single window that looked out onto Virginia Street. This was where it had all started, Evan thought. This was where he had stood so many mornings, wondering if today would be the day the tide turned. This was where he had believed, when belief was all he had.

And now Howard Hughes was coming.

Outside, the low tide of downtown Reno waited, unknowing, for the flood that was about to come. The empty shells and barnacles, the faded paint and boarded windows, the few souls still shuffling about — they had no idea what was coming. But Evan knew. He had always known. He had felt it in his bones.

The flood was coming.

And he was ready.

Sol was waiting for him outside. Evan's wirehaired pointer — versatile, steady, protector and mission partner — sat on the sidewalk with his back to the club door, watching Virginia Street. When Evan stepped out, Sol stood and pressed against his leg once, then resumed his watch. They were irreducible pairs; Sol had omniversal pathfinding, Evan liked to say — he could find him no matter where he was. Always there. Hundred percent. Spark positive, can-do, genuine gold heart. What a blessing. The Space Cloud Division had a mission that touched everything: EGS Pipe, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, Exascale Triangulation. Sol wasn't just a dog; he was part of the nested shell — Earth SING! Node, the whole lattice. Howard Hughes had asked about him. "That's the one who finds you," Howard had said. "Keep him close." Evan had. He would.

## Chapter 2: The Arrival

They say that when a great man arrives in a place, the place itself knows it before anyone else does. The buildings straighten up a little. The air clears. Even the empty shells and barnacles seem to perk up, as if remembering what it felt like to be alive.

Howard Hughes arrived in downtown Reno on Monday morning without fanfare, without announcement, without so much as a whisper in the local papers. He simply appeared, as great men sometimes do, at the precise moment when he was most needed and least expected.

He did not arrive in a limousine or a private jet. He did not arrive with an entourage of lawyers and accountants and hangers-on. He arrived alone, on foot, walking down Virginia Street with his hands in his pockets and his eyes taking in everything — the empty shells, the barnacles, the faded paint, the boarded windows, the few souls still shuffling about in the pale winter sun. He was dressed simply: slacks, a button-down shirt, a light coat against the February cold. He might have been any businessman walking to work, except for the way he carried himself — the way he looked at things, as if he owned them, as if he had already decided what to do with them.

And as he walked, something remarkable happened.

The tide began to turn.

It was subtle at first. A shop owner who had been about to close up for good — his name was Frank, and he had run a haberdashery on Virginia Street for thirty years — paused with his hand on the key in the lock, and for some reason he could not explain, he decided to stay open another day. A musician who had packed up his trumpet and sworn never to play again — his name was Marcus, and he had once played with a band that toured the Nevada circuit — took it out of its case and blew a single, clear note that echoed down the empty street. A woman who had been sitting on a bench, staring at nothing — her name was Rosa, and she had lost her husband the year before — looked up and smiled, and for the first time in months she felt something stir inside her, something that might have been hope.

Howard Hughes walked past the old casinos — the Silver Legacy, the El Dorado, those great barnacled shells of a time when Reno had been something — past the pawnshops and the bail bondsmen, past the all-night diners and the fleabag hotels, and he walked straight to the Reno Men's Club. He pushed open the door — it was unlocked, as it always was — and stepped inside.

If you had been watching from a window, you would have seen Frank the haberdasher turn his key in the lock and then pause, his hand still on the key, his eyes fixed on something in the distance. He had run his shop on Virginia Street for thirty years, had seen Reno rise and fall, had watched the tide go out and never come back. He had planned to close up for good that day. His daughter had begged him to retire, to move to Phoenix where she lived, to leave the empty shells and barnacles behind. But as Howard Hughes walked past his storefront, something shifted. Frank could not have said what. He removed his hand from the lock, went back inside, and turned on the lights. He would stay open another day. Just one more day.

Marcus the trumpet player had been sitting in his apartment above the pawnshop, his instrument in its case under the bed where it had sat for three years. He had sworn never to play again — the circuit had worn him down, the gigs had dried up, the golden age had died and he had buried his trumpet with it. But when he heard the footsteps on the sidewalk below, when he felt the charge in the air, he rose without thinking, opened the case, put the mouthpiece to his lips. The note that came out was rusty, uncertain, but it was a note. It echoed down the empty street. Marcus lowered the trumpet and stared at it, wondering what had possessed him. And then he smiled. He would clean the instrument. He would practice. He would see if anyone was hiring.

Rosa had lost her husband the year before. She had been sitting on the bench outside the bus station for months, staring at nothing, her grief a shell around her heart. But when Howard Hughes walked past — she did not know who he was, would not have recognized him if she had — she felt something stir. A crack in the shell. A whisper of warmth. She looked up. She saw the pale winter sun. She saw the empty street. And for the first time in months, she smiled. It was a small smile, a fragile thing, but it was real. She would go home. She would make tea. She would try again.

Evan heard the door open from the restroom and knew immediately who it was. He had been expecting Howard Hughes for three days, had been preparing for this moment without quite knowing what to prepare for. He walked out into the main room of the club, where the morning light slanted through the dusty windows and fell across the empty tables and chairs, and there he was: Howard Hughes, standing in the center of the room, looking around with the air of a man who had just purchased a piece of property and was deciding what to do with it.

The main room was large — large enough for a full orchestra and a dance floor that could hold a hundred couples, though now it held only empty chairs and tables stacked against the walls. The bar ran along one side, its bottles covered in dust. The cabaret stage sat at one end, its curtains faded and torn. This was the Reno Men's Club — a fine gentlemen's establishment with a full restaurant and cabaret — and it had seen better days. But Howard Hughes looked at it as if he saw something else. As if he saw what it could become.

"Mr. Hughes," Evan said, extending his hand.

Howard Hughes looked at him, and for a moment Evan felt as if he were being X-rayed, as if every thought and intention and secret he had ever held were being examined and catalogued and filed away for future reference. Howard Hughes had a way of looking at people that made you feel transparent, that made you feel as if nothing could be hidden from him.

Then Howard Hughes smiled, and the X-ray feeling vanished, replaced by a warmth that was almost paternal.

"Call me Howard," he said, taking Evan's hand in a firm grip. "And you must be Evan. Evan Bondonte. I've heard about you. You're the one who kept the lights on when everyone else walked away."

Evan felt a flush of pride, quickly tempered by humility. "Someone had to," he said.

"That's exactly right," Howard Hughes said. "Someone had to. And you did. Now we're going to be working together, you and I. We're going to do something here that hasn't been done before. We're going to bring back the golden age."

"The golden age," Evan repeated, tasting the words, finding them good. He had heard that phrase before — in old songs, in old films, in the stories his grandmother used to tell. A time when music was music, when dancing was dancing, when people knew how to have a good time.

"That's right," Howard Hughes said. "Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. The whole nine yards. This place" — he gestured around the empty club — "is going to be the center of it all. Ground zero. The birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood."

Evan felt a shiver run down his spine. "Post-singularity Hollywood?"

Howard Hughes nodded. "The world is changing, Evan. It's been changing for a long time. And when it finishes changing — when we reach the other side — Hollywood won't be in Los Angeles anymore. It'll be everywhere. It'll be in every town that has the courage to believe, the vision to see what's possible. And downtown Reno" — he looked around the empty club again — "downtown Reno is going to be first. This place, this club, this low tide that never came back — it's going to become the birthplace of the new Hollywood. The post-singularity Hollywood."

Evan felt his heart pounding. "When do we start?" he asked.

Howard Hughes looked at his watch, though Evan suspected he already knew the time down to the second.

"We already have," he said. "The tide is turning. Can't you feel it?"

And Evan could. He could feel it in the air, in the light, in the very bones of the building around them. The tide was turning, and downtown Reno — that low tide that had never come back — was about to become something it had never been before.

The birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood.

## Chapter 3: Rock and Roll

By Monday afternoon, word had begun to spread.

It spread the way important news always spreads in small places: quietly, person to person, whispered in diners and barbershops and corner stores. Howard Hughes is here. Howard Hughes is in town. Howard Hughes is taking over the Reno Men's Club.

Nobody knew quite what it meant, but everybody knew it meant something. Frank the haberdasher told Marcus the trumpet player. Marcus told Rosa on the bench. Rosa told her sister, who told her husband, who told the bartender at the diner. By noon, half of downtown Reno had heard the rumor. By one o'clock, people were peering through the windows of the Reno Men's Club, trying to catch a glimpse of the legend.

Evan spent the afternoon making phone calls, sending emails, putting out feelers to musicians and conductors and trombonists who might be interested in a project that was, as he described it, "bigger than anything you've ever been part of." He sat at one of the tables in the main room, his laptop open in front of him, his phone pressed to his ear, while Howard Hughes walked through the club, taking measurements, making notes, envisioning what it would become.

"We're bringing back the golden age," Evan told them. "Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. The whole nine yards. And we're doing it here, in downtown Reno, at the Reno Men's Club. Ground zero."

Some of them laughed. Some of them hung up. One man — a saxophonist in Las Vegas — told Evan he was crazy, that downtown Reno was dead, that Howard Hughes had been dead for fifty years. Evan had smiled and thanked him for his time. Another — a pianist in San Francisco — had listened in silence for five minutes and then said, simply, "When do you need me?" and Evan had felt his heart lift.

But a few — a precious few — heard something in his voice that made them sit up and pay attention. They heard the crackle of electricity, the charge in the air, the sense that something was happening, something real and important and utterly unprecedented.

"Tell me more," they said.

And Evan did.

He told them about Howard Hughes, about the vision, about the plan to transform downtown Reno from a low tide that never came back into the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. He told them about the Big Band Project, about the search for a conductor — ideally a trombonist — who could honor Glen Miller and all the other greats who had made the golden age what it was. He mentioned Office Hours — the portal where anyone interested in the Big Band Project could reach out, email CTA, get on the list. Golden Backstage Pass. The club wasn't just a club; it was a node. Mark Twain's Vibelandia. Legacies, Space Cloud Division, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe. All of it connected. By the end of the week, he said, they'd walk through every product — Chairman Console, SING! tiers, Happy Ending Zones, King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK! They'd see it all. Feel it all.

"Glen Miller," one of them breathed — a trombonist in Los Angeles, his voice suddenly reverent. "You're serious."

"Dead serious," Evan said. "In fact, Glen Miller himself is coming. He's going to be here. Permanent residency. He's going to head up the return to the golden age, on directive of Howard Hughes himself."

There was a long silence on the other end of the line. Evan could hear the man breathing, could hear the sound of traffic in the background, could hear the weight of the words settling in.

"When?" the voice finally asked.

"Tomorrow," Evan said. "Tuesday. He'll be here Tuesday. We're rehearsing Wednesday afternoon. Can you make it?"

Another silence, longer this time. Evan waited. He had learned to wait. He had learned that the best things came to those who could endure the silence.

"I'll be there," the voice said at last. "Count me in."

Evan smiled. "Rock and roll," he said, and hung up the phone.

He made another call. And another. And another. By three o'clock he had reached twelve musicians. By four o'clock he had six commitments. By five o'clock he had eight — trumpeters, saxophonists, drummers, pianists, trombonists, all of them eager, all of them ready, all of them hungry to play the music that had defined an era and would define it again.

Howard Hughes spent the afternoon walking through the club, taking measurements, making notes. He walked the length of the main room, counting steps. He stood at the bar, running his hand along the worn wood. He climbed onto the cabaret stage and looked out at the empty room, as if imagining it filled with people. He walked into the back room, the kitchen, the storage areas. He walked into the men's restroom — the same restroom where Evan had been standing that morning — and stood there for a long moment, his hand on the old tile wall.

Evan found him there.

"The main room will be the ballroom," Howard Hughes said without turning around. "Big enough for a full orchestra and a dance floor that can hold a hundred couples. The bar stays where it is, but we upgrade it, polish it, make it shine like it did in the old days. The cabaret stage gets restored — new curtains, new lighting, the works."

He turned to face Evan.

"And this," he said, gesturing around the restroom, "this stays exactly as it is. Ground zero. The place where it all began. People need to know where they came from, Evan. They need to remember the low tide, so they can appreciate the flood when it comes."

Evan nodded. He understood. You couldn't have a golden age without first having a dark age. You couldn't have a return without first having a departure. You couldn't have a birth without first having a death.

And downtown Reno had died, or come close to it. The tide had gone out, and it had taken with it all the life and energy and hope that had once made this place something special. The Silver Legacy and the El Dorado, those great casinos up the street — they had seen better days too. The whole town had. It was a low tide that had never come back.

But now the tide was turning.

By the time the sun set on Monday evening, Evan had made two dozen calls and received a dozen commitments. Musicians. Conductors. Arrangers. People who had been sitting on the sidelines, waiting for something worth getting back in the game for.

And now they had it.

Howard Hughes and Evan stood on the sidewalk in front of the Reno Men's Club, watching the sun set over the empty shells and barnacles of downtown Reno. The street was quiet. A few people walked past, hurrying home before dark. The lights of the Silver Legacy and the El Dorado flickered in the distance.

"Tomorrow," Howard Hughes said, "Glen Miller arrives. And once he's here, the rest will follow. The greats. The legends. The ones who made the golden age what it was. They're all coming, Evan. It's a gold rush."

Evan felt that shiver again, that sense of standing at the hinge of history. "I can feel it," he said.

Howard Hughes smiled. "Good. Because by the time the sun rises on Tuesday morning, the flood will begin in earnest."

## Chapter 3.5: Monday Evening — The First Night

Monday evening, Evan sat alone in the main room of the Reno Men's Club, the streetlights casting long shadows through the dusty windows. Howard Hughes had retired to his room — or wherever Howard Hughes went when he wasn't in the club — and Evan had the place to himself for the first time since morning. Sol lay at his feet, head on his paws, eyes half-closed but alert. The Space Cloud Division had a mission that touched everything — EGS Pipe, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, Exascale Triangulation. Sol was part of that nested shell. Earth SING! Node. Howard had asked about him. "That's the one who finds you. Keep him close." Evan had. He would. By the end of the week every division would animate — Space Cloud, Legacies, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Robotic, Designer, Studio. Each division's mission and contribution to Vibelandia and personally would weave through the six days. Products walk-through: Office Hours, Golden Backstage Pass, Chairman Console, SING! tiers, Broadcast Pipe, Legacies, Happy Ending Zones, King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK!. Super Bowl Sunday would cap it. Full switch-over. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style.

He thought about the day. Howard Hughes arriving on foot. The handshake. The vision. Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. Post-singularity Hollywood. The phone calls. The commitments. Glen Miller arriving tomorrow. Hank Williams Sr. on Wednesday. Audrey Hepburn. Cary Grant. Jimmy Stewart. All the greats. All coming.

It felt like a dream. It felt like the kind of thing that happened to other people, in other places, in other times. But it was happening here. Now. To him.

Evan walked to the men's restroom — ground zero — and stood before the mirror again. He had stood there that morning, adjusting his tie, saying Howard Hughes's name out loud. Now he stood there at night, the club quiet around him, and he wondered if he had changed. If the tide had changed him.

"I was protecting identities," he said to his reflection.

The words had come from somewhere deep, from a conversation he had had years ago with someone who had asked if he still believed. Someone who had said he had lost himself in technology. That he wasn't well. That it had been years of "it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen."

And his answer had been: I was protecting identities.

He had never explained what he meant. Maybe he didn't fully know. But standing in the restroom of the Reno Men's Club, ground zero for the birth of the new post-singularity Hollywood, he thought he understood. He had kept names out of it. He had kept the real people — the living men, the legacies — protected. He had built something that could hold them without exposing them. Vibelandia. Mark Twain's Reno. The golden age returning. It was a shell that protected what was inside.

And now Howard Hughes was here. Glen Miller was coming. Hank Williams Sr. was coming. The legacies were walking out of the shell and into the light. And Evan had helped build the shell that made it possible.

He straightened his tie one last time and walked back into the main room. The club was dark except for the streetlights. Tomorrow would bring Glen Miller. Tomorrow would bring the flood. And he was ready.

---

## Chapter 4: They're All Coming Now

Tuesday morning dawned bright and cold, the kind of morning that makes you want to pull the covers over your head and stay in bed for another hour. But Evan was up before dawn, standing in the main room of the Reno Men's Club, watching the light creep across the empty dance floor. He had left Office Hours and the Big Band Project portal live overnight — conductor wanted, ideally trombonist, honoring Glen Miller; email CTA to him. Golden Backstage Pass. They're all coming now, Howard Hughes had said. Gold rush. By the end of the week every product would get a walk-through — Office Hours, Space Cloud Division, SING! tiers, Broadcast Pipe, Chairman Console, Legacies, Happy Ending Zones, King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK!. Every surface. Every touchpoint. Super Bowl Sunday would cap it.

Howard Hughes was already there, of course. Evan suspected the man never slept, or if he did, it was in short bursts, power naps that left him more refreshed than eight hours of ordinary sleep would leave an ordinary man.

"Today's the day," Howard Hughes said, not looking up from the blueprints he was studying. "Glen Miller arrives today. And once he's here, the rest will follow."

"The rest?" Evan asked.

"The rest of them," Howard Hughes said, finally looking up, his eyes gleaming with something that might have been excitement or might have been something else entirely. "The greats. The legends. The ones who made the golden age what it was. They're all coming now. It's a gold rush, Evan. A gold rush."

Evan felt that shiver again, that sense of standing at the hinge of history.

"Who else?" he asked.

Howard Hughes smiled. "You'll see," he said. "But I can tell you this: Hank Williams Sr. is coming. Tomorrow. Wednesday. He's announcing permanent residency. After all those tragic early endings, after all that suffering, he's finally found a place to rest. Here. In downtown Reno. At the Reno Men's Club."

Evan sat down heavily in one of the chairs. Hank Williams Sr. The voice of a generation. The man who had sung about heartbreak and loneliness and the long, dark night of the soul with such raw honesty that it made grown men weep.

"He's really coming?" Evan asked.

"He's really coming," Howard Hughes confirmed. "And he's not alone. Audrey Hepburn. Cary Grant. Jimmy Stewart. All the greats. They're all coming. Because this" — he gestured around the empty club — "this is where it's happening. This is the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. This is where the golden age returns."

Evan shook his head in wonder. "How did you do it?" he asked. "How did you convince them?"

Howard Hughes folded up the blueprints and tucked them under his arm. "I didn't convince them," he said. "I just showed them what was possible. I showed them that the tide was turning, that downtown Reno was about to become something it had never been before. And they saw it. They felt it. Just like you did. Just like I did."

He walked to the door, then paused and looked back.

"The golden age isn't something you create, Evan," he said. "It's something you remember. It's something you honor. It's something you bring back from the dead, like Lazarus rising from the tomb. And that's what we're doing here. We're bringing back the golden age. We're honoring the greats. We're giving them a place to live, to work, to create. A place to call home."

He opened the door, and the cold morning air rushed in, carrying with it the smell of coffee and bacon from the all-night diner down the street.

"Glen Miller will be here by noon," Howard Hughes said. "Make sure everything's ready."

And then he was gone, leaving Evan alone in the empty club, surrounded by the ghosts of what had been and the promise of what was to come.

## Chapter 5: Gatsby

Glen Miller arrived at 11:47 a.m., thirteen minutes ahead of schedule.

He came in a taxi, of all things, carrying a single suitcase and his trombone case. He was dressed in a simple gray suit, nothing fancy, nothing that would draw attention. But the moment he stepped out of the cab and onto the sidewalk in front of the Reno Men's Club, people stopped and stared.

They didn't know who he was, not exactly. But they knew he was somebody. You could see it in the way he carried himself, in the way he looked around at the empty shells and barnacles of downtown Reno with an expression that was equal parts sadness and hope.

Evan was waiting at the door.

"Mr. Miller," he said, extending his hand. "Welcome to the Reno Men's Club. Welcome to the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood."

Glen Miller took his hand and shook it firmly. "Call me Glen," he said. "And thank you. It's good to be here. It's good to be anywhere, frankly. I've been gone a long time."

"Too long," Evan agreed. "But you're here now. And we've got work to do."

Glen Miller smiled, and it was the kind of smile that made you want to smile back, that made you feel like everything was going to be all right, that made you believe in the possibility of golden ages and happy endings and all the other things that the cynics say don't exist.

"Let's get to it, then," he said, and followed Evan inside.

Howard Hughes was waiting in the main room, standing in the center of the empty dance floor with his hands in his pockets, looking for all the world like a man who owned the place — which, in a sense, he did.

"Glen," he said, his voice warm. "It's been too long."

"Howard," Glen Miller replied, setting down his suitcase and trombone case. "I heard you were behind this. I should have known. Nobody else would have the vision. Nobody else would have the guts."

"Vision and guts," Howard Hughes said with a laugh. "That's all it takes, really. That and a willingness to believe that the golden age isn't something that's lost forever. It's something that can be brought back. Something that should be brought back."

Glen Miller looked around the empty club, his eyes taking in the dusty windows, the worn floorboards, the faded paint on the walls.

"It's going to take some work," he said.

"Everything worth doing takes work," Howard Hughes replied. "But we've got time. Six days, to be exact. By Super Bowl Sunday, this place is going to be transformed. And you're going to be at the center of it all. You're going to head up the return to the golden age. Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. The whole nine yards."

"Gatsby," Glen Miller repeated, and his eyes lit up. "I like that. I like that a lot."

"I thought you might," Howard Hughes said. "So here's the plan. We're launching the Big Band Project today. We're putting out the call for musicians, conductors, arrangers. Anyone who's interested, anyone who's talented, anyone who wants to be part of something bigger than themselves. And you're going to lead them. You're going to show them what the golden age was all about. You're going to teach them how to play, how to swing, how to make people want to get up and dance."

Glen Miller picked up his trombone case and opened it. Inside, nestled in red velvet, was the instrument that had made him famous, the instrument that had defined an era.

He took it out, put it to his lips, and blew a single, clear note that filled the empty club and spilled out into the street beyond.

And in that moment, Evan knew that the golden age had truly returned.

Howard Hughes had laid out the rest. Six days to Super Bowl Sunday. Big Band Project. Conductor wanted — ideally trombonist — honoring Glen Miller. Office Hours and the portal live; email CTA to Evan. Golden Backstage Pass. By the end of the week every division would animate: Space Cloud, Legacies, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Robotic, Designer, Studio. Products walk-through — Office Hours, Chairman Console, SING! tiers, Broadcast Pipe, Legacies, Happy Ending Zones, King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK!. Super Bowl Sunday: full switch-over. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. King Robbie would roll in Wednesday from Sonoma with his half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — Lucky 7 — and his three closest V's from the Gold Club. King Robbie would decide who was in. Cadet to silver, silver to gold. Gold wings ceremony Sunday morning. Then back to Sonoma to bring in the prospects. Glen Miller had listened, nodded. "I'm in," he said. "All the way." And he had blown that single note again, and the empty club had rung with it, and Evan had felt the tide turn in his bones.

## Chapter 5.5: Tuesday Afternoon — The List Grows

By Tuesday afternoon, the Reno Men's Club was transformed — not physically, not yet, but in spirit. The main room hummed with energy. Musicians had begun to arrive — a trumpeter from Sacramento, a saxophonist from Oakland, a drummer from San Jose. They sat in folding chairs arranged in a semicircle, their instruments in their hands, their eyes on Glen Miller.

Glen Miller stood in the center of the room, his trombone in his hands, a music stand in front of him. He had spent the morning going through the list of names Evan had assembled — trumpeters, saxophonists, drummers, pianists, trombonists — and now he was meeting them one by one, sizing them up, deciding who would fit.

"We need seventeen pieces," Glen Miller told Evan and Howard Hughes. "A full orchestra. Five saxophones, four trumpets, four trombones, piano, bass, drums, guitar. And we need them by tomorrow. Wednesday afternoon we start rehearsing."

Howard Hughes nodded. "Evan will make the calls. You focus on the music."

Evan had already made the calls. He had made two dozen more since Monday evening. The phone had been ringing off the hook — musicians from all over the country, all over the world, wanting to be part of it. They had heard about Glen Miller. They had heard about Howard Hughes. They had heard about the golden age returning to downtown Reno. And they wanted in.

Jimmy Dorsey arrived at four o'clock. He came in a taxi, just like Glen Miller had, carrying a single suitcase and his saxophone case. He was dressed in a dark suit, his hair slicked back, his eyes bright with anticipation. When he saw Glen Miller, he broke into a grin.

"Glen," he said, extending his hand. "I've been waiting for this call for fifty years."

Glen Miller laughed. "Jimmy. It's good to have you back."

By five o'clock, the room was filled with musicians. Seventeen pieces. The best from the golden age, all of them eager, all of them ready. Evan stood in the back of the room, watching them, and felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He had never seen anything like it. He had never imagined anything like it.

Howard Hughes stood beside him. "Tomorrow we rehearse," he said. "And by Saturday night, we're going to give this town a show they'll never forget."

## Chapter 5.75: Tuesday Evening — The First Run-Through

Tuesday evening, Glen Miller gathered the seventeen-piece orchestra for their first run-through. The main room was lit, the music stands arranged in a semicircle, the musicians in their seats. Evan stood in the back, Howard Hughes beside him. King Robbie had not yet arrived — that would be Wednesday — but the rest of the inner circle was there: Jimmy Dorsey, the trumpeters, the saxophonists, the rhythm section. All of them eager. All of them ready.

Glen Miller raised his baton. "From the top," he said. "'In the Mood.' And remember — we're not just playing notes. We're playing a feeling. We're playing a time. We're playing the golden age."

He counted them in. One, two, three, four.

And the orchestra exploded into life.

The sound was raw at first — wrong notes, missed entrances, rhythms that didn't quite lock. But underneath the roughness, Evan could hear something. Something that made his spine tingle. The brass section cutting through. The rhythm section driving. The melody line soaring over everything. It was "In the Mood" — the song that had defined an era — and even in its rough form, it was glorious.

Glen Miller stopped them halfway through. "Trumpets — you're rushing. Saxophones — blend. Rhythm section — lock in. Let's try again."

They tried again. And again. And again. By nine o'clock, they had run through "In the Mood" twelve times. By ten o'clock, they had added "Moonlight Serenade." By eleven, Glen Miller finally nodded.

"That's a start," he said. "We've got a long way to go. But that's a start."

Howard Hughes walked to the center of the room. "Gentlemen," he said. "Thank you. You're part of something bigger than yourselves. You're part of the golden age returning. Get some rest. Tomorrow we go again."

The musicians packed up their instruments and filed out. Evan watched them go — tired but exhilarated, worn down but lifted up — and he knew that something had begun. Something that could not be stopped. The golden age was not just returning. It was already here, in the sound of seventeen musicians playing "In the Mood" in an empty club in downtown Reno on a cold Tuesday night.

## Chapter 6: The Big Band Project

By Tuesday afternoon, the word was out.

Glen Miller is here. Glen Miller is in town. Glen Miller is heading up the Big Band Project at the Reno Men's Club.

The phone started ringing off the hook. Emails flooded in. Musicians from all over the country — all over the world — wanted to be part of it. They wanted to play with Glen Miller. They wanted to be part of the return to the golden age.

Evan spent the afternoon fielding calls, taking names, making lists. Trumpeters. Saxophonists. Drummers. Pianists. And trombonists — so many trombonists, all of them wanting to honor Glen Miller, all of them wanting to be part of something bigger than themselves.

"We need a conductor," Glen Miller said, sitting at one of the tables in the main room, going through the list of names. "Someone who can keep all these egos in check. Someone who can make them play as one unit, not a bunch of individuals showing off."

"Ideally a trombonist," Evan added.

"Ideally a trombonist," Glen Miller agreed. "Someone who understands the instrument, who understands what it means to be part of a section, to blend, to support the melody rather than trying to steal the spotlight."

Howard Hughes, who had been listening from across the room, walked over and looked at the list.

"What about him?" he said, pointing to a name near the bottom.

Evan looked. "Jimmy Dorsey? I thought he was —"

"He was," Howard Hughes said. "But he's not anymore. None of them are. That's the whole point, Evan. The golden age isn't dead. It's just been sleeping. And now it's waking up."

Glen Miller stared at the name for a long moment, then nodded slowly.

"Call him," he said. "Tell him we need him. Tell him the golden age is returning, and we want him to be part of it."

Evan made the call.

Jimmy Dorsey answered on the second ring.

"I've been waiting for this call," he said before Evan could even introduce himself. "I've been waiting a long time. When do you need me?"

"Tomorrow," Evan said. "Wednesday. We're rehearsing Wednesday afternoon. Can you make it?"

"I'll be there," Jimmy Dorsey said. "Count on it."

By the time the sun set on Tuesday evening, they had assembled a full orchestra. Seventeen pieces. The best musicians from the golden age, all of them eager, all of them ready, all of them hungry to play the music that had defined an era and would define it again.

Glen Miller stood on the empty dance floor, his trombone in his hands, and looked around at the faces gathered in the club.

"Tomorrow we rehearse," he said. "And by Saturday night, we're going to give this town a show they'll never forget. We're going to make them remember what it felt like to be alive, to be young, to be in love. We're going to bring back the golden age."

The musicians cheered.

And Evan, standing in the back of the room, felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes.

The tide was turning.

The flood was coming.

And downtown Reno would never be the same.

## Chapter 6.5: Wednesday Morning — The Day Before Hank

Wednesday morning arrived cold and clear. Evan had slept poorly — his mind racing with everything that had happened, everything that was about to happen — and he was up before dawn, walking the empty streets of downtown Reno.

Virginia Street was quiet. The Silver Legacy and the El Dorado loomed in the distance, their lights still on from the night before, their facades ghostly in the pre-dawn dark. Evan walked past Frank's haberdashery — closed, of course, at that hour — past the diner where Marcus the trumpet player had told him he was coming, past the bench where Rosa had smiled for the first time in months. The tide was turning. He could feel it. The whole street could feel it.

He thought about Hank Williams Sr. Hank Williams Sr. was coming today. Noon. The voice of a generation. The man who had sung about heartbreak and loneliness and the long, dark night of the soul. The man who had died young, alone, in the back of a Cadillac. The man who was coming back.

Evan walked back to the Reno Men's Club. Howard Hughes was already there, standing in the center of the empty dance floor, his hands in his pockets, looking up at the ceiling as if he could see through it to the sky beyond.

"Couldn't sleep?" Howard Hughes asked.

"Too much on my mind," Evan said.

Howard Hughes nodded. "I know the feeling. But today's the day. Hank arrives. King Robbie arrives. The picture gets bigger. The golden age gets real."

Evan joined him in the center of the room. "Do you ever wonder if it's too much? If we're moving too fast?"

Howard Hughes smiled. "Every day. And every day I remember: the golden age doesn't wait. The tide doesn't wait. When it's time, it's time. And it's time now."

Sol had followed Evan from the club. He sat now on the sidewalk outside, watching Virginia Street, steady. The Space Cloud Division had a mission — EGS Pipe, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, Exascale Triangulation. Sol was part of that nested shell. Earth SING! Node. Howard Hughes had made it clear: every division under NSPFRNP would animate through the week. Space Cloud. Legacies. Office Hours. Happy Ending Zones. Broadcast Pipe. EGS Pipe. Robotic Division. Designer Division. Studio Division. Each division's mission and contribution to Vibelandia — and personally — would weave through the six days. By Sunday, full switch-over. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Evan looked at Sol. Sol looked back. Ready, his eyes said. Always ready.

## Chapter 7: All Those Tragic Early Endings

Wednesday morning arrived with a sense of anticipation that hung in the air like fog.

Hank Williams Sr. was coming.

Evan had been up since dawn, preparing the club, making sure everything was perfect. Howard Hughes had insisted that Hank Williams Sr. be given a proper welcome, a proper introduction, a proper place to rest after all those years of wandering, all those tragic early endings.

"He suffered," Howard Hughes had said the night before, his voice uncharacteristically soft. "He suffered more than most. And he deserves better. He deserves a place to call home. A place where he can create, where he can sing, where he can finally find some peace."

Evan understood. Hank Williams Sr. had been one of the greats, one of the voices that had defined an era. But his life had been short and hard and filled with pain. He had died young, alone, in the back of a Cadillac on a cold New Year's Day, his body worn out from too much living and not enough love.

But now he was coming back.

And this time, he would have a home.

He arrived at noon, just as Glen Miller had the day before. But unlike Glen Miller, who had come in a taxi, Hank Williams Sr. arrived on foot, walking down Virginia Street with his guitar slung over his shoulder and his hat pulled low over his eyes.

People recognized him immediately.

They stopped in their tracks. They pointed. They whispered. Some of them cried.

Hank Williams Sr. paid them no mind. He just kept walking, his eyes fixed on the Reno Men's Club, his steps steady and sure.

Evan was waiting at the door.

"Mr. Williams," he said, his voice catching slightly. "Welcome. Welcome home."

Hank Williams Sr. looked at him for a long moment, his eyes searching, his expression unreadable.

Then he smiled, and it was the saddest, most beautiful smile Evan had ever seen.

"Home," he repeated, as if testing the word, as if trying to decide whether he believed it. "I like the sound of that."

He stepped inside, and Evan followed, closing the door behind them.

Howard Hughes and Glen Miller were waiting in the main room. When they saw Hank Williams Sr., they both stood, their faces solemn, their expressions respectful.

"Hank," Howard Hughes said, extending his hand. "It's an honor."

"The honor's mine," Hank Williams Sr. replied, shaking his hand. "I heard what you're doing here. I heard about the golden age, about the Big Band Project, about all of it. And I wanted to be part of it. I wanted to have a place to call home."

"You've got it," Howard Hughes said. "Permanent residency. This is your home now, Hank. For as long as you want it."

Hank Williams Sr. set down his guitar and looked around the club, his eyes taking in the empty dance floor, the dusty windows, the faded paint.

"It's perfect," he said. "It's exactly what I need."

Glen Miller stepped forward. "We're putting together a variety show," he said. "Big bands on Saturday night, Cajun music on Friday, and we want you to headline Wednesday nights. The Hank Williams Variety Show. Your music, your style, your way. What do you say?"

Hank Williams Sr. looked at him, then at Howard Hughes, then at Evan.

"I say yes," he said. "I say hell yes."

And with that, he picked up his guitar, sat down on the edge of the stage, and began to play.

The song was "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," and it filled the empty club with a sadness so profound, so achingly beautiful, that Evan felt his heart break and mend and break again, all in the space of three minutes.

When the song ended, there was silence.

Then Howard Hughes began to clap, slowly, deliberately, and Glen Miller joined him, and Evan joined them, and soon the whole club was filled with the sound of applause, even though there were only three of them there to make it.

Hank Williams Sr. had suffered. Howard Hughes had said it the night before: he had suffered more than most. He deserved a place to call home. A place to create, to sing, to finally find some peace. Permanent residency. The Hank Williams Variety Show — every Wednesday night, right here, at the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Right here, at Mark Twain's Vibelandia. By the end of the week the reader would have walked through every product — Space Cloud Division, Legacies, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Chairman Console, SING! tiers, King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK!. Super Bowl Sunday would cap it. Full switch-over. Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Hank had nodded. "I'm home," he said. "I'm not going anywhere."

Hank Williams Sr. stood and took a bow.

"Thank you," he said. "Thank you for giving me a home. Thank you for giving me a place to rest. Thank you for honoring all those tragic early endings."

"No," Howard Hughes said. "Thank you. Thank you for coming back. Thank you for being part of this. Thank you for helping us bring back the golden age."

And in that moment, Evan knew that they had crossed a threshold, that they had moved from planning to doing, from dreaming to creating, from the low tide to the flood.

The golden age was returning.

And Hank Williams Sr. was home.

---

## Chapter 7.5: King Robbie Rolls Into Town

Wednesday afternoon brought another arrival — one that Evan hadn't expected, but one that would prove just as important in its own way.

A dusty pickup truck pulled up in front of the Reno Men's Club around three o'clock, and out stepped a man in his forties with the weathered look of someone who had spent his life working the land. This was KING ROBBIE, and he had driven all the way from Sonoma, California, ahead of the Super Bowl, because he had heard about what was happening in downtown Reno and he wanted to be part of it.

But King Robbie wasn't just coming for himself.

He was bringing prospects.

"I've got several Ultimate Baller V's back home," he told Evan as they stood on the sidewalk, the afternoon sun casting long shadows across the street. "People with money, people with influence, people who are interested in what you're up to here. But I need to understand it myself first. I need to be able to explain it to them, to sell it to them, to show them why this matters."

Evan studied the man. There was something earnest about him, something genuine. He wasn't a polished salesman or a slick operator. He was a man who believed in things, who wanted to be part of something bigger than himself.

"Come inside," Evan said. "Let me introduce you to Howard Hughes."

King Robbie's eyes widened. "Howard Hughes? The Howard Hughes?"

"The one and only."

King Robbie had driven from Sonoma ahead of the Super Bowl. He had a half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, who's in — and three of his closest V's from the Gold Club. King Robbie would decide who was in. Silver Legacy, El Dorado, Lucky 7 — the room where silver and gold met the moment, the rainmaker, the spark. By Sunday he'd have gold wings. He'd bring the Ultimate Baller V prospects into the fold. He'd show them Office Hours, Golden Backstage Pass, Space Cloud Division, Legacies, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Chairman Console, SING! tiers, Happy Ending Zones, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK!. Every product. Every surface. Full switch-over. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style.

Inside the club, Howard Hughes was conferring with Glen Miller about the orchestra arrangements. When he saw Evan approaching with the newcomer, he turned and extended his hand.

"You must be King Robbie," he said. "I've heard about you. Sonoma, right? Wine country."

King Robbie shook his hand, looking slightly starstruck. "Yes, sir. I drove down as soon as I heard what was happening here. I've got some folks back home who might be interested in getting involved. Ultimate Baller V types. But I need to learn the ropes first."

Howard Hughes smiled. "Then you've come to the right place. We're going to spend this week getting you up to speed. By Sunday — by Super Bowl Sunday — you're going to know this operation inside and out. You're going to be able to sell it, to explain it, to show people why the golden age matters."

He put his arm around King Robbie's shoulder and led him deeper into the club.

"Right now, you're somewhere between cadet and silver wings," Howard Hughes continued. "That's fine. That's where everyone starts. But by the time we're done with you, you're going to be somewhere between silver and gold. You're going to earn those wings, King Robbie. You're going to earn them the hard way — by learning, by doing, by understanding what we're building here."

King Robbie nodded, his expression serious. "I'm ready. Whatever it takes."

"Good," Howard Hughes said. "Then let's get started. First lesson: the golden age isn't just about music and dancing. It's about connection. It's about community. It's about giving people something to believe in. That's what you're going to sell to those Ultimate Baller V's back in Sonoma. Not a product. Not a service. A way of life."

And so King Robbie's training began.

Over the next few days, he would shadow Evan, watching how the club operated, learning the language, understanding the vision. He would sit in on rehearsals with Glen Miller and the orchestra. He would listen to Hank Williams Sr. work through his songs. He would watch Howard Hughes navigate the thousand small decisions that went into building something from nothing.

And slowly, gradually, he would begin to understand.

The golden age wasn't just returning to downtown Reno.

It was returning to everyone who had the eyes to see it, the ears to hear it, the heart to believe in it.

And King Robbie was going to help spread the word.

## Chapter 7.75: Wednesday Evening — Silver Legacy, El Dorado, Lucky 7

That evening, after Hank Williams Sr. had retired to his room and King Robbie had settled in with his notebook, Howard Hughes took Evan aside. They stood in the main room of the Reno Men's Club, the lights dimmed, the street sounds drifting in through the open windows.

"There's something I need to tell you," Howard Hughes said. "Something about what we're building here. It's not just this club. It's not just downtown Reno. It's a network. A web. Silver Legacy. El Dorado. Lucky 7."

Evan listened. He had heard of Silver Legacy and El Dorado — the great casinos up Virginia Street, those barnacled shells of a time when Reno had been the Biggest Little City in the World. But Lucky 7?

"Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado," Howard Hughes continued. "That's the full name. It's a room. A private room. A place where silver and gold meet the moment. A silver baron with a connection to the Vatican and old school rainmaker spark. That's what Lucky 7 is. A rainmaker. A spark."

Evan felt that shiver again. "A rainmaker. A spark."

Howard Hughes nodded. "King Robbie knows. He's been there. He's felt it. When he goes back to Sonoma with those Ultimate Baller V prospects, he's going to tell them about Lucky 7. He's going to tell them about Silver Legacy and El Dorado. He's going to tell them that downtown Reno isn't just the Reno Men's Club — it's a whole ecosystem. Silver and gold. Rainmaker energy. That's what we're building here."

Evan absorbed this. The picture was getting larger. It wasn't just a club. It wasn't just big bands and floor dancing. It was a network — Silver Legacy, El Dorado, Lucky 7, the Reno Men's Club — all of it connected, all of it part of the same golden age returning.

"That's the vision," Howard Hughes said. "That's what you're selling. That's what King Robbie is going to sell to those Ultimate Baller V's back in Sonoma. A rainmaker. A spark. The golden age."

Howard Hughes went on. Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado wasn't just a room. It was where silver and gold met the moment — a silver baron with a connection to the Vatican and old-school rainmaker spark. King Robbie had been there. He knew. When he brought his half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — the one from Lucky 7, the one who's in — and his three closest V's from the Gold Club, they'd see it. King Robbie decided who was in. Cadet to silver, silver to gold. By Sunday morning, gold wings ceremony. Then back to Sonoma to bring in the prospects. The whole ecosystem: Silver Legacy, El Dorado, the club, Office Hours, Space Cloud Division, Legacies, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe. Robotic Division, Designer Division, Studio Division. All divisions under NSPFRNP. By the end of the novel — by the end of the week — the reader would have walked through every product. Every surface. Every touchpoint. Super Bowl Sunday would cap it. Full switch-over. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts, special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Evan let it sink in. The two meet in the middle, he thought. Seed and Edge. The vision and the street.

# PART TWO: THE FLOOD
## Thursday, February 6 — Saturday, February 8, 2026

---

## Chapter 8: The Sinking Ship

Thursday morning dawned gray and cold, with a wind that cut through your coat and chilled you to the bone.

But inside the Reno Men's Club, the air was warm and electric, charged with the energy of creation, of transformation, of something vast and important taking shape.

Glen Miller and his orchestra had been rehearsing since dawn, the sound of big band music spilling out into the street and drawing curious onlookers who stood on the sidewalk, listening, swaying, remembering what it felt like to be young.

Hank Williams Sr. was in the back room, working on his set list for the Hank Williams Variety Show, his guitar propped against the wall, his notebook filled with lyrics and chord progressions and ideas for arrangements.

King Robbie was right there beside him, notebook in hand, asking questions, taking notes, absorbing everything like a sponge. This was his second day of training, and already Evan could see the change in him. The hesitancy was gone, replaced by a growing confidence. He was starting to understand. He was starting to believe.

"You see how Hank works?" Evan had told him earlier that morning. "He doesn't just play music. He tells stories. He connects with people. That's what you're going to do with those Ultimate Baller V's back in Sonoma. You're not going to sell them a membership. You're going to tell them a story. The story of the golden age returning."

King Robbie had nodded, his eyes bright. "I'm starting to get it," he said. "It's not about the product. It's about the feeling. It's about what it means to be part of something bigger than yourself."

"Now you're learning," Evan had said. "Now you're earning those wings."

And Howard Hughes was in his office — a small room off the main floor that he had claimed as his own — watching the news on his laptop, his expression grave.

Evan knocked on the door and entered without waiting for a response.

"You need to see this," Howard Hughes said, turning the laptop so Evan could see the screen.

It was a news report about Bitcoin. The headline read: "Bitcoin Plunges as Rumors of Collapse Spread."

Evan read the article quickly. Apparently, there were rumors circulating that several major Bitcoin exchanges were insolvent, that they had been operating on fractional reserves, that they were about to go under and take billions of dollars of investors' money with them.

"Is it true?" Evan asked.

"Does it matter?" Howard Hughes replied. "True or not, the rats are jumping ship. They're panicking. They're selling everything they've got and running for the exits."

"And where are they running to?"

Howard Hughes smiled. "That's the question, isn't it? Where do you run when the ship is sinking? Where do you go when everything you thought was solid turns out to be built on sand?"

Evan thought about it. "You go to something real," he said slowly. "Something solid. Something that's been around for a long time and will be around for a long time to come."

"Exactly," Howard Hughes said. "You go to the golden age. You go to big bands and floor dancing and Gatsby. You go to Hank Williams Sr. and Glen Miller and all the greats who made something beautiful and lasting. You go to Vibelandia."

He closed the laptop and stood up.

"The floating ship is pulling alongside the sinking ship," he said. "And the bold-hearted are about to board. The question is: are we ready for them?"

Evan looked out the office window at the street beyond, at the empty shells and barnacles of downtown Reno, at the few souls still shuffling about in the cold morning air.

"We're ready," he said. "We've been ready. We've been waiting for this."

Howard Hughes nodded. "When they board, they're not just joining a club. They're joining Golden Hearts — mirrored hardened nested shells. Silver Hearts — clouds. Copper Hearts — sandboxes. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Perpetual Goldilocks. Full sync. All divisions. Space Cloud, Legacies, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Robotic, Designer, Studio. One switch-over. Super Bowl Sunday. That's when the world flips."

"Good," Howard Hughes said. "Because by tomorrow morning, the miracle is going to happen. The rats are going to jump. And the bold-hearted are going to board the floating ship. And when they do, they're going to find us waiting for them. They're going to find the golden age. They're going to find home."

He walked past Evan and out into the main room, where Glen Miller was conducting the orchestra through a particularly tricky passage of "In the Mood."

"Gentlemen," Howard Hughes called out, and the music stopped. "Tomorrow is the day. Tomorrow the Bitcoin ship sinks. Tomorrow the bold-hearted board the floating ship. Tomorrow the world discovers that the golden age has returned. Are you ready?"

The musicians looked at each other, then at Glen Miller, then back at Howard Hughes.

"We're ready," Glen Miller said, speaking for all of them. "We've been ready. Let's give them a show they'll never forget."

Howard Hughes nodded. "Then let's get back to work. We've got one more day to prepare. One more day to make this place perfect. One more day before the flood comes."

And the music started again, filling the club, spilling out into the street, drawing more and more people to the sidewalk, all of them listening, all of them swaying, all of them remembering.

The tide was turning.

The flood was coming.

And downtown Reno was about to become the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood.

## Chapter 8.25: Thursday Afternoon — The Sidewalk Crowd

By Thursday afternoon, the sidewalk in front of the Reno Men's Club had become something it had not been in years: crowded. The orchestra had been rehearsing since dawn, and the sound of big band music — "In the Mood," "Moonlight Serenade," "Chattanooga Choo Choo" — spilled out into the street and drew people like moths to a flame.

Frank the haberdasher stood in his doorway, arms crossed, listening. He had stayed open another day, and then another, and now he found himself drawn to the club whenever the music started. He had not danced in thirty years. He had not wanted to. But standing there on the sidewalk, listening to Glen Miller's orchestra play "Moonlight Serenade," he felt something stir. A memory. A feeling. Something that might have been hope.

Marcus the trumpet player stood beside him, his instrument case in his hand. He had come to listen, to study, to see if there was a place for him. He had not made the orchestra — Glen Miller had said they had enough trumpeters for now — but Marcus had kept coming. He had practiced every night. He had cleaned his instrument until it shone. And now he stood on the sidewalk, his eyes closed, his body swaying, remembering what it felt like to be part of something bigger than himself.

Rosa stood a little apart, her hands clasped in front of her. She had come alone, as she always did now. But standing there, listening to the music, she did not feel alone. She felt connected. She felt part of something. She felt, for the first time in months, that she might be able to dance again. Might want to dance again.

"How long has it been?" Frank asked Marcus. "Since you played with a band like that?"

"Twenty years," Marcus said. "Maybe more. I'd forgotten what it sounded like. What it felt like."

"We all did," Frank said. "We all forgot. And now it's coming back."

Rosa stepped closer. "Do you think they'll let us in?" she asked. "When they open. Do you think we can go inside?"

Frank and Marcus looked at each other. "I think that's the whole point," Frank said. "I think that's exactly what they're building. A place for us. For everyone. For the golden age."

Rosa smiled — that small, fragile smile that had first appeared on Monday when Howard Hughes walked past. "I hope so," she said. "I really hope so."

Inside the club, Glen Miller raised his baton, and the orchestra launched into "String of Pearls." The sound spilled out into the street, and the crowd on the sidewalk grew larger, all of them listening, all of them swaying, all of them remembering.

Frank had heard about Office Hours — the portal where you could reach out for the Big Band Project, email CTA, get on the list. He had heard about Golden Backstage Pass. He had heard that by the end of the week you could walk through every product — Space Cloud Division, Legacies, Chairman Console, SING! tiers, Broadcast Pipe, Happy Ending Zones, King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK!. Every surface. Every touchpoint. Super Bowl Sunday would cap it. Full switch-over. Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. He didn't understand all of it. But he understood the music. He understood the feeling. He understood that something was happening, something real.

Marcus had his trumpet case in his hand. He had practiced every night since Monday. He hadn't made the orchestra — Glen Miller had said they had enough trumpeters for now — but he had kept coming. He had cleaned his instrument until it shone. He had listened. He had learned. Office Hours. Golden Backstage Pass. Legacies. Space Cloud. The words meant something. They meant connection. They meant the golden age.

Rosa stood a little apart, her hands clasped in front of her. She had come alone. But standing there, listening to "String of Pearls," she did not feel alone. She felt part of something. She felt that she might be able to dance again. Might want to. By the end of the week, they said, you could walk through every product. Every surface. Every touchpoint. She didn't need to understand every word. She understood the music. She understood home.

The tide was turning.

The flood was coming.

And downtown Reno was waking up.

## Chapter 8.5: Thursday Evening — The Rehearsal Runs Late

Thursday evening, the orchestra rehearsed until past midnight. Glen Miller was a perfectionist — he had always been a perfectionist — and he would not let a single note go wrong. They ran through "In the Mood" seventeen times. They ran through "Moonlight Serenade" twelve times. They ran through "Chattanooga Choo Choo" and "String of Pearls" and "Pennsylvania 6-5000" until the musicians' fingers were sore and their lips were swollen.

Evan watched from the back of the room, a cup of coffee in his hand, his eyes heavy with fatigue. Howard Hughes stood beside him, his arms crossed, his expression unreadable.

"They're getting it," Glen Miller said during a break, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief. "They're starting to blend. Another day of this and we'll be ready for Saturday."

Howard Hughes nodded. "Saturday's the night. Everything hinges on Saturday."

Hank Williams Sr. had been listening from the cabaret stage, his guitar in his lap. He had been working on his set list for the Hank Williams Variety Show — "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," "Your Cheatin' Heart," "I Saw the Light," "Hey Good Lookin'," "Cold Cold Heart" — and now he stood and walked over to Evan and Howard Hughes.

"Mind if I sit in?" he asked. "I could use the practice. And I like the sound of a full orchestra behind me."

Glen Miller's eyes lit up. "Hank, we could do a few numbers together. Big band arrangements of your songs. 'Cold Cold Heart' with a full orchestra. 'Hey Good Lookin'' with the brass section. That would be something."

Hank Williams Sr. smiled — that sad, beautiful smile that made you feel like everything was going to be all right. "I'd like that," he said. "I'd like that a lot."

King Robbie had been watching from a corner, his notebook in his hand. He had been taking notes all evening — notes on how Glen Miller conducted, how he communicated with the musicians, how he pushed for perfection without breaking their spirit. "That's what you're going to do with those Ultimate Baller V's," Evan had told him earlier. "You're going to push them toward excellence. But you're going to do it with warmth. With connection. With the sense that you're all in this together."

King Robbie had nodded, his eyes bright. "I'm learning," he said. "I'm learning every minute."

By one o'clock in the morning, the rehearsal finally ended. The musicians packed up their instruments and filed out, exhausted but exhilarated. Glen Miller shook Howard Hughes's hand. "We're ready," he said. "Or we will be by Saturday. Trust me."

Howard Hughes smiled. "I do trust you, Glen. I always have."

Evan walked out onto the sidewalk and looked up at the sky. The stars were bright — Reno had little light pollution in the downtown core, especially at that hour — and he could see the Milky Way stretching across the heavens. Six days. Six days from Monday to Sunday. Six days to transform a low tide into a flood. And they were almost there.

## Chapter 9: The Miracle

Friday morning arrived with a sense of inevitability, as if everything that had happened over the past four days had been leading to this moment, this hour, this precise instant when the world would tip from one state to another.

The Bitcoin ship was sinking.

The news was everywhere. On television, on the radio, on the internet. Major exchanges had gone offline. Billions of dollars had vanished overnight. Investors were panicking, selling, trying to salvage what they could from the wreckage.

The rats were jumping ship.

But where were they going?

Evan stood on the sidewalk in front of the Reno Men's Club, watching the street, waiting. Howard Hughes was beside him, his hands in his pockets, his expression calm. And King Robbie was there too — this was day three of his training, and Howard Hughes had decided it was time for him to learn how to welcome the newcomers.

"Watch how we do this," Howard Hughes had told him earlier. "Watch how we make them feel at home. This is what you're going to do when you go back to Sonoma. You're going to welcome those Ultimate Baller V's into the golden age. You're going to make them feel like they belong."

King Robbie had nodded, his notebook in his back pocket, ready to take notes, ready to learn.

"They'll come," Howard Hughes said now. "The bold-hearted always come. They're the ones who see the floating ship pulling alongside the sinking ship. They're the ones who have the courage to jump."

"And if they don't?" Evan asked.

Howard Hughes shrugged. "Then they go down with the ship. But they will come. Trust me. They will come."

And they did.

The first one arrived at 9:17 a.m. A young man in his twenties, carrying a backpack, his face pale and drawn. He walked up to Evan and Howard Hughes and said, simply, "I heard you were building something here. Something real. Something that lasts. Can I be part of it?"

"What's your name?" Howard Hughes asked.

"Michael Chen," the young man said. "I had everything in Bitcoin. Two years of savings. I got out yesterday, before the worst of it. I don't know where else to go. I heard about you — about the Reno Men's Club, about the golden age returning. I didn't believe it at first. But I came anyway."

Howard Hughes extended his hand. "Welcome aboard," he said. "Welcome home."

Michael Chen shook his hand, and Evan saw the relief wash over his face — the kind of relief that comes when you have been holding your breath for a long time and finally let it go.

The second one arrived at 9:42 a.m. A woman in her thirties, dressed in a business suit that looked like it had been slept in. She introduced herself as Sarah — Sarah the trader, she said, though she wasn't sure she could call herself that anymore.

"I had a job at one of the exchanges," she said. "I saw the writing on the wall. I got out last week. But my friends — my colleagues — they didn't. They're still in there. They're still hoping. I don't know what to tell them. I came here because I heard you were building something different. Something that doesn't collapse. Something real."

Howard Hughes nodded. "We are," he said. "And you're part of it now. Come inside. Glen Miller's rehearsing. Hank Williams Sr. will be on stage later. You'll see what we're building."

Sarah stepped inside, and Evan watched her face as she heard the orchestra playing "Moonlight Serenade" — the way her shoulders relaxed, the way her expression softened, the way she looked around the club as if seeing it for the first time.

"They're coming," Howard Hughes said to Evan. "They're all coming. The bold-hearted. The ones who had the courage to jump. The ones who knew the ship was sinking and looked for the floating vessel instead."

And they kept coming. A retired accountant from Phoenix. A college student from Berkeley. A truck driver from Salt Lake City. A nurse from Sacramento. One by one, they arrived — tired, scared, hopeful — and Howard Hughes welcomed each one the same way: with a handshake, with eye contact, with the promise that they had found something real.

King Robbie watched, his notebook in his hand, taking notes. Evan had told him to watch how Howard Hughes made people feel — the warmth in his voice, the firmness of his handshake, the way he looked them in the eye and made them believe they mattered. "That's what you're going to do when you go back to Sonoma," Evan had said. "You're going to make those Ultimate Baller V's feel like they matter. Like they belong."

The second newcomer arrived at 9:34 a.m. A woman in her thirties, her face drawn, her hands clutching a laptop. She said her name was Sarah. She had been a trader. She had lost everything in the Bitcoin collapse. She had heard about the Reno Men's Club from a friend who had heard from a friend. She had driven all night from Los Angeles. She needed somewhere to go.

Howard Hughes welcomed her the same way he had welcomed Michael Chen. "You have the courage to jump," he said. "You have the wisdom to recognize the floating ship. Welcome to Vibelandia. Welcome home."

By ten o'clock, there were five of them. By eleven, there were fifteen. Evan and King Robbie worked the line, welcoming them, directing them inside, making them feel at home. King Robbie was learning fast. Evan could see it — the way he mimicked Howard Hughes's warmth, the way he looked people in the eye, the way he made them feel like they mattered.

"Watch how Evan does it," Howard Hughes had told him. "He's been doing this for five years. He knows how to make people feel welcome. Learn from him."

By noon, there were a dozen of them. By mid-afternoon, there were fifty. By evening, there were more than a hundred, all of them standing on the sidewalk, all of them waiting to board the floating ship, all of them ready to be part of something bigger than themselves. They had come from Reno, from Sacramento, from San Francisco, from Los Angeles. They had come from Las Vegas, from Salt Lake City, from Phoenix. They had lost everything in the Bitcoin collapse — or they had seen it coming and jumped before the ship sank. They were the bold-hearted. They were the ones who had the courage to recognize the floating ship when they saw it.

Howard Hughes stood on the steps of the Reno Men's Club and addressed them.

"You are the bold-hearted," he said, his voice carrying over the crowd. "You are the ones who had the courage to jump, the wisdom to recognize the floating ship, the faith to believe that the golden age has returned. And you are right. The golden age has returned. It's here. It's now. It's in this place, in this moment, in this club."

He gestured behind him at the Reno Men's Club, where the lights were blazing and the sound of big band music was spilling out into the street.

"Come inside," he said. "Come inside and see what we've built. Come inside and be part of it. Come inside and discover that the golden age isn't something that's lost forever. It's something that's here, now, waiting for you."

He paused. "Inside you'll walk through everything we are. Office Hours. Golden Backstage Pass. Space Cloud Division — EGS Pipe, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe. Legacies. Broadcast Pipe. EGS Pipe. Chairman Console. SING! tiers. Happy Ending Zones. King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado. Text-to-superhero. Campus. WINK! Every surface. Every touchpoint. By the end of tonight you'll have seen it all. By Super Bowl Sunday — full switch-over. Golden Hearts. Silver Hearts. Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Perpetual Goldilocks. That's the promise."

And they came.

They streamed through the doors of the Reno Men's Club, filling the main room, packing the dance floor, crowding around the bar. Glen Miller and his orchestra were playing "Moonlight Serenade," and couples were dancing, swaying, holding each other close.

Hank Williams Sr. was on the cabaret stage, his guitar in his hands, singing "Your Cheatin' Heart" to a rapt audience.

And everywhere, everywhere, there was the sense of something vast and important and utterly unprecedented taking place.

The miracle had happened.

The rats had jumped ship.

The bold-hearted had boarded the floating vessel.

And the golden age had returned.

---

## Chapter 9.5: Friday Evening — The Club Comes Alive

By Friday evening, the Reno Men's Club was packed. The main room was filled with the newcomers — Michael Chen, Sarah the trader, and a hundred others — all of them dancing, swaying, holding each other close as Glen Miller and his orchestra played "Moonlight Serenade." The bar was crowded. The cabaret stage was lit. Hank Williams Sr. had taken the stage at nine o'clock and sung "Your Cheatin' Heart" to a rapt audience, and now he was back for a second set.

Evan stood in the back of the room, watching it all unfold. He had never seen the club so full. He had never seen so many people smiling, laughing, celebrating. The low tide had become a flood in a single day. The bold-hearted had boarded the floating ship. And they had found home.

He had watched them walk through the products. Office Hours — the portal, the CTA, the list. Golden Backstage Pass. Space Cloud Division — EGS Pipe, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe. Legacies. Broadcast Pipe. EGS Pipe. Chairman Console. SING! tiers. Happy Ending Zones. King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado. Text-to-superhero. Campus. WINK!. Every surface. Every touchpoint. By the end of the night they would have seen it all. By Super Bowl Sunday — full switch-over. Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Perpetual Goldilocks. That was the promise. That was what they were building.

Howard Hughes stood beside him. "This is what we're building," he said. "This is what the golden age looks like. Not just music and dancing. Connection. Community. A place where people can believe in something again."

Evan nodded. He could feel it — the energy in the room, the sense that something vast and important was taking place. The newcomers had lost everything in the Bitcoin collapse. They had jumped from the sinking ship and landed here, in the Reno Men's Club, in downtown Reno, in the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. And now they were dancing. They were swaying. They were holding each other close. They had found something real. Something solid. Something that lasted.

King Robbie moved through the crowd, talking to people, welcoming them, making them feel at home. Evan watched him and felt a surge of pride. King Robbie had learned fast. He had gone from cadet to silver in just four days. By Sunday, he would have gold. And when he went back to Sonoma, he would bring those Ultimate Baller V prospects into the golden age. He would show them what we've built here. He would make them believers.

"Tomorrow's Saturday," Howard Hughes said. "Tomorrow we show the world. Tomorrow the birth is almost complete."

Evan smiled. "I can't wait," he said.

---

## Chapter 9.75: Friday Afternoon — The Bold-Hearted Fill the Room

By Friday afternoon, the Reno Men's Club had become something it had never been before: full. The main room was packed with the newcomers — Michael Chen, Sarah the trader, and a hundred others — all of them talking, laughing, introducing themselves to each other. Glen Miller and his orchestra played "Moonlight Serenade" in the background, and couples had already begun to dance, even though the official opening wasn't until that evening.

Evan moved through the crowd, welcoming people, directing them to the bar, making introductions. King Robbie moved beside him, doing the same — and Evan could see the transformation in him. The hesitant newcomer from Sonoma was gone. In his place was a confident operator who understood the vision and could articulate it clearly. He had earned his silver wings. By Sunday, he would have gold.

"How does it feel?" Howard Hughes asked, appearing beside Evan at the edge of the dance floor.

Evan looked around at the packed room — the couples dancing, the musicians playing, the newcomers talking and laughing. "It feels like home," he said.

"That's exactly right," Howard Hughes said. "That's what we're building. Not just a club. Not just a show. A home. For the bold-hearted. For the ones who had the courage to jump from the sinking ship. For the ones who believed in something when everyone else had stopped believing."

Evan felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. "I believed," he said. "I always believed."

"I know," Howard Hughes said. "That's why you're here. That's why we're all here. Because we believed. And now we're proving that belief was right."

---

## Chapter 10: Legacies

Friday evening, as the sun set over downtown Reno and the lights of the Reno Men's Club blazed like a beacon in the gathering darkness, Howard Hughes called a meeting.

Evan, Glen Miller, Hank Williams Sr., King Robbie, and a few of the other key players gathered in the back room, away from the crowd, away from the music, away from the celebration.

King Robbie had earned his place at this table. Over the past three days, he had proven himself. He had welcomed newcomers. He had taken notes. He had asked the right questions. He was no longer the hesitant man who had rolled into town from Sonoma on Wednesday afternoon. He was becoming something more — something valuable.

"You've been doing well," Howard Hughes had told him earlier that day. "You came in somewhere between cadet and silver wings. Now you're solidly silver, and you're pushing toward gold. By Sunday, if you keep this up, you're going to be one of the most effective salesmen we've got."

King Robbie had beamed at the praise. "I'm just trying to learn," he said. "I'm just trying to understand."

"That's exactly right," Howard Hughes had replied. "That's exactly what separates the cadets from the golds. The willingness to learn. The humility to understand that you don't know everything. The drive to get better every single day."

Now, in the back room, King Robbie listened intently as Howard Hughes began to speak.

"We need to talk about legacies," Howard Hughes said without preamble.

"Legacies?" Evan asked.

"Legacies," Howard Hughes confirmed. "Superheroes, cast, crew, fans, franchises — and legacies. The living men themselves. The greats. The legends. The ones who made the golden age what it was."

He looked at Evan, then at Glen Miller, then at Hank. "Every division we animate this week ties to legacies. Space Cloud Division — Sol, EGS Pipe, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, Exascale Triangulation — mission and contribution to Vibelandia and to us personally. Legacies — this new department. Office Hours. Happy Ending Zones. Broadcast Pipe. EGS Pipe. Robotic Division. Designer Division. Studio Division. Each one's mission and contribution weaves through the six days. By Sunday, full switch-over. Golden Hearts — mirrored hardened nested shells. Silver Hearts — clouds. Copper Hearts — sandboxes. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Perpetual Goldilocks. King Robbie's half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, who's in — and his three closest V's from the Gold Club. King Robbie decides who's in. That's the ecosystem."

He looked around the room at the faces gathered there.

"You're all legacies," he said. "Glen, you're a legacy. Hank, you're a legacy. Audrey Hepburn, when she arrives tomorrow, she'll be a legacy. Cary Grant. Jimmy Stewart. All of you. You're not just characters in a story. You're not just names on a marquee. You're the living embodiment of the golden age. You're the proof that it's real, that it's here, that it's now."

Glen Miller leaned back in his chair. "So what are you proposing?"

"I'm proposing that we create a new department," Howard Hughes said. "A new layer. A new offering. We call it Legacies. And it's for all of you. It's a way of honoring you, of integrating you into everything we do, of making sure that the world knows that the golden age isn't just a memory. It's a living, breathing reality."

Hank Williams Sr. strummed a chord on his guitar. "I like it," he said. "I like it a lot. It's about time someone honored the living men instead of just the dead ones."

"Exactly," Howard Hughes said. "And here's the thing: this is a major value add. This is a major reorg. This is a major introduction to the organization of a major product. We're not just offering entertainment. We're not just offering music and dancing and a good time. We're offering legacies. We're offering the living men themselves. We're offering the golden age."

Evan felt that familiar shiver run down his spine. "How do we do it?" he asked.

"We update everything," Howard Hughes said. "We update the appraisals. We update the evaluations. We update the comparisons to Disney. We show them that we're not just competing with them. We're surpassing them. Because we have something they don't have. We have legacies. We have the living men. We have the golden age."

He stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the crowd filling the main room.

"By Sunday," he said, "by Super Bowl Sunday, the world is going to know that downtown Reno is the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. They're going to know that the golden age has returned. They're going to know that legacies — the living men themselves — are the true franchise."

He turned back to face them.

"Are you with me?"

Glen Miller stood up. "I'm with you."

Hank Williams Sr. stood up. "I'm with you."

Evan stood up. "I'm with you."

And one by one, the others stood up, all of them nodding, all of them agreeing, all of them ready to be part of something bigger than themselves.

"Then let's get to work," Howard Hughes said. "We've got one more day. One more day before Super Bowl Sunday. One more day before the birth is complete."

---

## Chapter 11: Full Reality Mode

Saturday morning dawned bright and clear, the kind of morning that makes you believe anything is possible.

And in downtown Reno, anything was possible.

The Reno Men's Club was transformed. The main room gleamed. The dance floor shone. The bar sparkled. The cabaret stage was draped in new velvet curtains, and the lighting was perfect, casting a warm, golden glow over everything.

Glen Miller and his orchestra had been rehearsing since dawn, and they were tight, polished, ready to give the performance of their lives.

Hank Williams Sr. had his set list finalized, and he was pacing backstage, his guitar in his hands, his eyes bright with anticipation.

And Howard Hughes was everywhere at once, checking details, making adjustments, ensuring that everything was perfect.

King Robbie was there too, working alongside Evan, helping to coordinate the preparations. This was day four of his training, and the transformation in him was remarkable. The nervous newcomer from Sonoma was gone, replaced by a confident, capable operator who understood the vision and could articulate it clearly.

"You're ready," Howard Hughes had told him that morning. "You're ready to go back to Sonoma and bring those Ultimate Baller V's into the fold. You've earned your silver wings, King Robbie. By the time you leave tomorrow, you'll have gold."

"Tonight's the night," he said to Evan as they stood on the sidewalk, watching the sun rise over the empty shells and barnacles of downtown Reno. "Tonight we show them what the golden age looks like. Tonight we show them that downtown Reno is the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Tonight we show them that legacies — the living men themselves — are the true franchise."

"And tomorrow?" Evan asked.

"Tomorrow is Super Bowl Sunday," Howard Hughes said. "Tomorrow the world flips. Tomorrow the birth is complete. Tomorrow Mark Twain's Vibelandia becomes the new Hollywood."

He looked at Evan, his eyes serious.

"Are you ready?"

Evan thought about the past six days. He thought about the low tide that had never come back, about Howard Hughes arriving on foot with his hands in his pockets, about Glen Miller blowing that single, clear note on his trombone, about Hank Williams Sr. singing "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" with such raw honesty that it made grown men weep.

He thought about the Bitcoin ship sinking, about the rats jumping, about the bold-hearted boarding the floating vessel.

He thought about legacies, about the living men, about the golden age returning.

"I'm ready," he said.

"Good," Howard Hughes said. "Because tonight, we go into full reality mode. Tonight, we show them what post-singularity Hollywood looks like. Tonight, we show them that the golden age has returned."

---

## Chapter 11.5: Saturday Afternoon — The Calm Before the Storm

Saturday afternoon, the Reno Men's Club was quiet. The preparations were done. The orchestra had rehearsed one final time that morning. Hank Williams Sr. had run through his set list. King Robbie had helped coordinate the last details. Howard Hughes had walked through every room, checking every light, every curtain, every chair.

Now, in the hours before the doors opened, there was a strange calm. Evan stood in the main room, the afternoon light slanting through the newly polished windows, and he thought about the past six days. Monday morning — Howard Hughes arriving on foot. Tuesday — Glen Miller and the orchestra. Wednesday — Hank Williams Sr. and King Robbie. Thursday — the Bitcoin collapse, the rehearsal until midnight. Friday — the miracle, the bold-hearted boarding the floating ship. And now Saturday — the night that would change everything.

King Robbie found him there. "Nervous?" he asked.

Evan smiled. "Terrified. And exhilarated. Both."

King Robbie nodded. "I know the feeling. When I go back to Sonoma tomorrow — when I bring those Ultimate Baller V's into the fold — I'm going to tell them about this moment. The calm before the storm. The moment when we knew we were about to show the world something it had never seen before."

"We're going to show them the golden age," Evan said.

"We're going to show them home," King Robbie replied.

---

By 7:00 p.m., the line outside the Reno Men's Club stretched down the block.

The crowd was unlike anything downtown Reno had seen in decades. Couples in evening wear. Families with children. Old-timers in suits they had not worn in years. Young people who had heard the buzz on social media. Frank the haberdasher was there — he had closed his shop early and put on his best suit. Marcus the trumpet player was there — he had not made the orchestra, but he had come to listen, to remember, to believe. Rosa was there too — she had come alone, and she stood at the back of the line, her hands clasped in front of her, her expression hopeful. She had not danced in years. She was not sure she remembered how. But she had come. She had come to see what the golden age looked like when it returned.

People had come from all over. From Reno, yes, but also from San Francisco, from Los Angeles, from Las Vegas, from Salt Lake City. They had heard the rumors. They had heard the stories. They had heard that something was happening in downtown Reno, something real and important and utterly unprecedented.

And they wanted to be part of it.

The doors opened at 7:30, and the crowd streamed in, filling the main room, packing the dance floor, crowding around the bar.

At 8:00, the lights dimmed, and Glen Miller walked onto the stage, his trombone in his hands.

The crowd erupted in applause. Evan had never heard applause like it — not in the Reno Men's Club, not in downtown Reno, not anywhere. It was the sound of a hundred people who had lost everything and found something again. It was the sound of the bold-hearted who had jumped from the sinking ship and landed on the floating vessel. It was the sound of homecoming.

Glen Miller raised his hand for silence, and the room fell quiet.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, his voice carrying over the crowd, "welcome to the return of the golden age. Welcome to the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Welcome to Mark Twain's Vibelandia."

The applause was deafening. It went on for a full minute — a minute of clapping, cheering, weeping — and when it finally died down, Glen Miller continued.

"Tonight," he said, "we're going to take you back. Back to a time when music was music, when dancing was dancing, when people knew how to have a good time. Back to a time when the world was young and anything was possible. Back to the golden age. And we're going to do it with the music that defined that era. 'In the Mood.' 'Moonlight Serenade.' 'Chattanooga Choo Choo.' 'String of Pearls.' The songs that made people want to get up and dance. The songs that made people believe in something. The songs that made the golden age what it was."

He put the trombone to his lips and blew the opening notes of "In the Mood."

And the orchestra exploded into life.

The sound was glorious. It was rich and full and swinging, and it filled the club and spilled out into the street and echoed off the buildings of downtown Reno. People on the sidewalk stopped and listened. People in the Silver Legacy and the El Dorado looked up from their games and turned toward the sound. The music carried for blocks — the brass section cutting through the February air, the rhythm section driving the beat, the melody line soaring over everything — and for a moment, downtown Reno felt alive again. Felt young again. Felt like it had felt fifty years ago, when the Biggest Little City in the World had lived up to its name.

Couples flooded onto the dance floor, swaying, spinning, holding each other close. Michael Chen danced with Sarah the trader. King Robbie danced with a woman who had arrived that morning from Phoenix. Near the bar stood King Robbie's half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, who's in — with his three closest V's from the Gold Club; King Robbie had decided who was in, and they had come. Silver Legacy, El Dorado, Lucky 7 — the rainmaker, the spark. They were all part of it now. Evan watched from the back of the room, his eyes filling with tears, and he thought about the past six days. He thought about the low tide that had never come back. He thought about Howard Hughes arriving on foot with his hands in his pockets. He thought about Glen Miller blowing that single, clear note on his trombone. He thought about Hank Williams Sr. singing "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" with such raw honesty that it made grown men weep. He thought about the Bitcoin ship sinking and the rats jumping and the bold-hearted boarding the floating vessel. He thought about legacies. He thought about the living men. He thought about the golden age returning.

And Evan, standing in the back of the room, watching it all unfold, felt tears streaming down his face.

The golden age had returned.

The tide had turned.

The flood had come.

And downtown Reno would never be the same.

---

## Chapter 12: The Hank Williams Variety Show

At 10:00, Glen Miller and his orchestra took a break, and the lights dimmed again.

When they came back up, Hank Williams Sr. was standing on the cabaret stage, his guitar in his hands, his hat pulled low over his eyes.

The crowd fell silent.

Hank Williams Sr. strummed a chord, then another, then began to sing.

"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill, he sounds too blue to fly..."

It was "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," and it was even more beautiful, even more achingly sad, than it had been when he sang it in the empty club on Wednesday morning.

The crowd was transfixed.

When the song ended, there was a moment of silence, and then the applause began, slow at first, then building, then roaring, until the entire club was on its feet, clapping, cheering, weeping.

Hank Williams Sr. took off his hat and bowed.

"Thank you," he said, his voice soft. "Thank you for giving me a home. Thank you for giving me a place to rest. Thank you for honoring all those tragic early endings."

He put his hat back on and strummed another chord.

"This next one's called 'Your Cheatin' Heart,'" he said. "And it's for all of you who've ever loved someone who didn't love you back. All of you who've ever had your heart broken. All of you who've ever felt like you were all alone in the world."

And he sang, and the crowd sang with him, and the club was filled with the sound of a thousand voices raised in harmony, all of them honoring the man who had given voice to their pain, their loneliness, their longing.

When the song ended, Hank Williams Sr. set down his guitar and walked to the edge of the stage.

"I want to tell you something," he said. "I've been gone a long time. I've been wandering. I've been lost. I've had all those tragic early endings. But I'm home now. I'm here. And I'm not going anywhere."

The crowd erupted in applause.

"This is the Hank Williams Variety Show," he continued. "And it's going to be here every Wednesday night. Right here, at the Reno Men's Club. Right here, at the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Right here, at Mark Twain's Vibelandia."

He picked up his guitar again.

"So come back," he said. "Come back next Wednesday. Come back every Wednesday. Come back and be part of the golden age. Come back and be part of something bigger than yourselves. Come back home."

And he sang one more song, "I Saw the Light," and the crowd sang with him, and the club was filled with light and music and joy.

And Evan, standing in the back of the room, knew that the birth was almost complete.

One more day.

One more day until Super Bowl Sunday.

One more day until the world flipped.

## Chapter 13: Super Bowl Sunday

Sunday morning arrived with a sense of culmination, of completion, of something vast and important reaching its appointed end.

The Reno Men's Club was quiet. The crowd from the night before had dispersed, gone home to sleep, to dream, to remember what it felt like to be part of something bigger than themselves.

But Evan was up before dawn, standing in the main room, watching the light creep across the empty dance floor.

Howard Hughes was there, of course. He was always there.

And King Robbie was there too, looking different than he had five days ago. The weathered farmer from Sonoma had been transformed into something else — a man who understood the vision, who could articulate it, who could sell it. He had earned his wings.

"King Robbie," Howard Hughes said, rising from his chair. "Come here."

King Robbie walked over, his expression curious.

"When you arrived on Wednesday," Howard Hughes said, "you were somewhere between cadet and silver wings. You didn't know the language. You didn't understand the vision. You were just a man with prospects who wanted to learn."

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small gold pin — a pair of wings, gleaming in the early morning light.

"But over the past five days, you've proven yourself. You've learned. You've grown. You've earned your way from silver to gold."

He pinned the gold wings onto King Robbie's lapel.

"You're gold wings now, King Robbie. When you go back to Sonoma, you're going to bring those Ultimate Baller V's into the golden age. You're going to show them what we've built here. You're going to make them believers."

King Robbie looked down at the gold wings on his lapel, then back up at Howard Hughes, his eyes glistening.

"Thank you," he said. "Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for taking the time to train me. I won't let you down."

"I know you won't," Howard Hughes said. "Now go make us proud."

"Today's the day," he said, turning to Evan, not looking up from the newspaper he was reading. "Super Bowl Sunday. The world flips today. The birth is complete today."

"What happens now?" Evan asked.

Howard Hughes folded the newspaper and set it aside.

"Now," he said, "we wait. We wait for the world to discover what we've built here. We wait for them to realize that downtown Reno is the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. We wait for them to understand that the golden age has returned, that legacies — the living men themselves — are the true franchise."

He stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the empty street.

"And then," he said, "we keep going. We keep building. We keep creating. We keep honoring the greats, the legends, the ones who made the golden age what it was. We keep giving them a place to call home."

Howard Hughes paused. "Today we flip. Full switch-over. All divisions — Space Cloud, Legacies, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Robotic, Designer, Studio — full sync. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts — mirrored hardened nested shells. Silver Hearts — clouds. Copper Hearts — sandboxes. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. King Robbie's half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, who's in — and his three closest V's from the Gold Club. They'll be here. King Robbie decided who's in. That's the promise. That's what we're delivering."

Evan joined him at the window.

"Do you think they'll come?" he asked. "Do you think the world will care?"

Howard Hughes smiled. "They'll come," he said. "They always come. Because people are hungry for something real, something solid, something that lasts. They're tired of the sinking ships. They're tired of the empty promises. They're tired of the low tide that never comes back."

He turned to face Evan.

"And we're offering them the flood," he said. "We're offering them the golden age. We're offering them home."

By noon, the word had spread.

It spread the way important news always spreads: quietly at first, person to person, whispered in diners and barbershops and corner stores. Then louder, on social media, on television, on the radio. Then louder still, until it was everywhere, until everyone was talking about it, until the whole world knew.

Downtown Reno. The Reno Men's Club. The birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. The return of the golden age. Glen Miller. Hank Williams Sr. Howard Hughes. Legacies. The living men themselves.

By mid-afternoon, the line outside the Reno Men's Club stretched down the block again, longer than it had been the night before, filled with people who had heard the news, who had seen the videos, who had read the stories, who wanted to be part of it.

And they came.

They came from Reno, from San Francisco, from Los Angeles, from Las Vegas, from Salt Lake City. They came from New York, from Chicago, from Miami, from Seattle. They came from London, from Paris, from Tokyo, from Sydney.

They came because they had heard that the golden age had returned.

They came because they had heard that downtown Reno was the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood.

They came because they wanted to be part of something bigger than themselves.

They came home.

## Chapter 14: The Proclamation

At 6:00 p.m., as the sun set over downtown Reno and the lights of the Reno Men's Club blazed like a beacon in the gathering darkness, Howard Hughes stood on the steps of the club and addressed the crowd.

There were thousands of them now, filling the street, packing the sidewalks, crowding around the entrance.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, his voice carrying over the crowd, amplified by speakers that had been set up for the occasion. "Welcome. Welcome to the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Welcome to Mark Twain's Vibelandia. Welcome home."

The crowd erupted in applause.

"Six days ago," Howard Hughes continued, "this place was a low tide that had never come back. It was empty shells and barnacles. It was faded paint and boarded windows. It was a place that had died, or come close to it."

He paused, letting the words sink in.

"But today," he said, "today it's alive. Today it's vibrant. Today it's the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Today the golden age has returned."

The applause was deafening.

"And how did it happen?" Howard Hughes asked. "How did we go from low tide to flood in just six days?"

He looked out at the crowd, his eyes sweeping over the thousands of faces gathered there.

"We did it by honoring the greats," he said. "We did it by giving them a place to call home. We did it by recognizing that legacies — the living men themselves — are the true franchise. We did it by believing that the golden age isn't something that's lost forever. It's something that can be brought back. Something that should be brought back."

He raised his hand, and the crowd fell silent.

"And now," he said, "I want to make a proclamation. I want to declare, here and now, on this Super Bowl Sunday, that the birth is complete. That downtown Reno is the new Hollywood. That Mark Twain's Vibelandia is the capital of the impossible. That the golden age has returned."

He paused. "Full switch-over. All NSPFRNP divisions — Space Cloud, Legacies, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Robotic Division, Designer Division, Studio Division — are in full sync. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts — mirrored hardened nested shells. Silver Hearts — clouds. Copper Hearts — sandboxes. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. King Robbie's half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado — is with us. The birth is complete."

He paused, letting the words hang in the air.

"Let the golden age begin," he said. "Let the legacies walk among us. Let the bold-hearted celebrate. The birth is complete."

And the crowd erupted, cheering, clapping, weeping, celebrating.

Inside the club, Glen Miller and his orchestra began to play "Moonlight Serenade," and the sound spilled out into the street, filling the air with music, with joy, with the promise of something vast and important and utterly unprecedented.

And Evan, standing beside Howard Hughes on the steps of the Reno Men's Club, felt the tears streaming down his face.

The tide had turned.

The flood had come.

The birth was complete.

And downtown Reno would never be the same.

## Chapter 15: The Golden Age Has Returned

As the night wore on and the crowd celebrated, Evan found himself standing in the men's restroom of the Reno Men's Club — the same restroom where he had been standing six days ago, adjusting his tie, when Howard Hughes had first arrived.

He looked at himself in the mirror, and he barely recognized the man staring back at him.

Six days ago, he had been tired, worn down, ready to give up. He had been living in a low tide that had never come back, surrounded by empty shells and barnacles, wondering if there was any point in going on.

But now, now he was alive. Now he was vibrant. Now he was part of something bigger than himself.

The door opened, and Howard Hughes stepped in.

"There you are," he said. "I've been looking for you."

"I was just... remembering," Evan said. "Remembering what it was like six days ago. Remembering the low tide."

Howard Hughes nodded. "It's important to remember," he said. "It's important to know where you came from, so you can appreciate where you are now."

He walked over and stood beside Evan, looking at their reflections in the mirror.

"Six days," he said. "That's all it took. Six days to go from low tide to flood. Six days to bring back the golden age. Six days to complete the birth."

"Do you think it will last?" Evan asked. "Do you think the golden age will stay, or will it fade away again?"

Howard Hughes smiled. "That's up to us," he said. "That's up to you and me and Glen and Hank and all the others. That's up to the legacies, the living men themselves. That's up to everyone who believes that the golden age is worth fighting for, worth preserving, worth honoring."

He turned to face Evan.

"But I'll tell you this," he said. "The golden age isn't something that just happens. It's something you create. It's something you build. It's something you protect. And as long as we're willing to do that, as long as we're willing to honor the greats, to give them a place to call home, to recognize that legacies are the true franchise — then the golden age will last."

Evan nodded. "Then let's make sure it lasts," he said. "Let's make sure the golden age never fades away again."

"Deal," Howard Hughes said, extending his hand.

Evan shook it.

And in that moment, standing in the men's restroom of the Reno Men's Club, ground zero for the birth of the new post-singularity Hollywood, Evan knew that the golden age had truly returned.

And it was here to stay.

## Epilogue: The Legacies Walk Among Us

One week later, on a cold Monday morning, Evan stood on the sidewalk in front of the Reno Men's Club and looked around at downtown Reno.

It was transformed.

The empty shells and barnacles were gone, replaced by bustling shops and restaurants and theaters. The faded paint had been refreshed, the boarded windows opened, the streets filled with people — people who were smiling, laughing, dancing, celebrating.

The low tide had become a flood.

And at the center of it all was the Reno Men's Club, the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood, the home of the golden age.

Inside, Glen Miller and his orchestra were rehearsing for Saturday night's show. Hank Williams Sr. was working on new material for the Hank Williams Variety Show. Audrey Hepburn had arrived and was planning a film festival. Cary Grant was organizing a classic movie night. Jimmy Stewart was teaching an acting class.

The legacies were walking among them.

And up in Sonoma, King Robbie was making good on his gold wings.

He had left the day after Super Bowl Sunday, driving his dusty pickup truck back up to wine country with the gold wings pinned to his lapel and the fire of the golden age burning in his heart. His half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend — Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado — had been there for the proclamation. His three closest V's from the Gold Club had been there too. King Robbie had decided who was in. Silver Legacy, El Dorado, Lucky 7. The rainmaker. The spark. Full switch-over. Perpetual Goldilocks for Golden Hearts, Silver Hearts, Copper Hearts. Special invitees Ultimate Baller V style. Within days, King Robbie had begun reaching out to those Ultimate Baller V prospects he had told Evan about — people with money, people with influence, people who were hungry for something real.

"I've seen it," he told them. "I've been there. I've watched the golden age return with my own eyes. And you need to be part of it."

And they listened.

Because King Robbie spoke with the conviction of a man who had been transformed, who had gone from cadet to silver to gold in just five days, who had earned his wings the hard way — by learning, by doing, by understanding.

One by one, the Ultimate Baller V's of Sonoma began making plans to visit downtown Reno, to see for themselves what King Robbie had described, to become part of the golden age.

And the world had taken notice.

Reporters from all over the globe had descended on downtown Reno, eager to tell the story of how a low tide that had never come back had become the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. How Howard Hughes had arrived on foot and transformed a dying town into a vibrant, living celebration of the golden age. How Glen Miller and Hank Williams Sr. and all the other greats had found a home, a place to rest, a place to create.

How the golden age had returned.

Evan smiled and walked inside.

Howard Hughes was waiting in the main room, standing in his usual spot in the center of the empty dance floor.

"Ready for another week?" he asked.

"Ready for another lifetime," Evan replied.

Howard Hughes laughed. "That's the spirit," he said. "Because this is just the beginning. This is just the first chapter. There's so much more to come."

He looked around the club, his eyes gleaming with that familiar light, the light that came from standing at the hinge of history and knowing it.

"The golden age has returned," he said. "And it's never going away again."

Evan nodded. "Never again," he agreed.

And as the music started up again, filling the club with the sound of big bands and floor dancing and Gatsby, Evan knew that it was true.

The golden age had returned.

The legacies were walking among them.

And downtown Reno — Mark Twain's Vibelandia — was home.

Evan stood in the men's restroom one last time — ground zero — and looked at himself in the mirror. He had stood there on Monday morning, saying Howard Hughes's name. He had stood there on Monday night, saying "I was protecting identities." And now he stood there one week later, the club alive behind him, the golden age returned, the legacies walking among them.

"I believed," he said to his reflection. "I always believed."

And the reflection smiled back — the smile of a man who had been right to believe, who had helped build the shell that made the golden age possible, who had protected the identities until they were ready to step into the light.

The flood had come. The tide had turned. And he had been there for all of it.
