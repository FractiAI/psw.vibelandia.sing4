## ACT ONE: THE LOW TIDE
### Monday, February 3 — Wednesday, February 5, 2026

---

### FADE IN:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - MONDAY MORNING - DAWN

The sun rises over downtown Reno, casting long shadows across empty streets. The camera moves slowly down VIRGINIA STREET, revealing a landscape that looks like a tide that went out and never came back.

Empty storefronts. Boarded windows. Faded neon signs that no longer light up. A few HOMELESS PEOPLE shuffle along the sidewalk. A STRAY DOG sniffs at a pile of garbage.

The high-water marks are visible on the buildings — faded paint where signs once hung, darker patches where awnings once provided shade. Empty shells. Barnacles. A place that died, or came close to it.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MEN'S RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

A man stands before the mirror, adjusting his tie. This is EVAN BONDONTE (40s), neither young nor old, neither handsome nor plain, but with eyes that suggest he has seen things, done things, been places most men only dream about.

The restroom is old but clean. Black and white tile. Porcelain fixtures. A single window that looks out onto the street.

Evan stares at his reflection, his expression unreadable.

**EVAN**  
(to his reflection)  
He's here.

He pauses, as if listening to a response only he can hear.

**EVAN** (CONT'D)  
Howard Hughes is here.

He smiles slightly.

**EVAN** (CONT'D)  
And I'm working for him now. We're gonna do this right. Walt's been doing a good job, sure. But it's time for Howard. Time for the real show to begin.

He pauses, studying his reflection.

**EVAN** (CONT'D)  
I believed. I always believed the tide would turn. That this place — these empty shells — would become something again. And now he's here. Howard Hughes is here. And we're going to bring back the golden age.

He straightens his tie one last time, then turns and walks out.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The main room is large and empty. Dusty windows let in pale morning light. Tables and chairs are stacked against the walls. A stage sits at one end, its curtains faded and torn. A long bar runs along one side, bottles covered in dust.

This was once a fine gentlemen's club — full restaurant and cabaret — but now it looks abandoned, forgotten, left behind by the tide.

Evan walks to the center of the room and stands there, looking around, seeing not what it is but what it could be.

The FRONT DOOR opens, letting in a shaft of bright morning light.

A silhouette appears in the doorway. A man. Hands in his pockets. Looking around with the air of someone who has just purchased a piece of property and is deciding what to do with it.

This is HOWARD HUGHES (60s, but ageless), dressed simply in slacks and a button-down shirt. There is something about him that commands attention, that suggests power and vision and an absolute certainty in his own abilities.

Evan turns to face him.

**EVAN**  
Mr. Hughes.

He extends his hand.

Howard Hughes steps into the room, the door closing behind him. He walks slowly toward Evan, his eyes taking in every detail — the dusty windows, the stacked furniture, the faded curtains, the bottles covered in dust.

He reaches Evan and takes his hand in a firm grip.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Call me Howard.

He looks around the room again.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
We're going to be working together, you and I. We're going to do something here that hasn't been done before.

**EVAN**  
What's that?

Howard Hughes turns to face him, and Evan feels as if he's being X-rayed, as if every thought and intention and secret he has ever held is being examined and catalogued and filed away for future reference.

Then Howard Hughes smiles, and the X-ray feeling vanishes, replaced by a warmth that is almost paternal.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
We're going to bring back the golden age.

**EVAN**  
(tasting the words)  
The golden age.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
That's right. Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. The whole nine yards. This place is going to be the center of it all. Ground zero. The birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood.

Evan feels a shiver run down his spine — not of fear, but of anticipation.

**EVAN**  
When do we start?

Howard Hughes looks at his watch.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
We already have. The tide is turning. Can't you feel it?

And Evan can. He can feel it in the air, in the light, in the very bones of the building around them.

**EVAN**  
(softly)  
I can feel it.

Howard Hughes nods, satisfied.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Good. Then let's get to work. We've got six days. Six days to transform this place. Six days to bring back the golden age. Six days to complete the birth.

He walks toward the stage, his footsteps echoing in the empty room.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
(over his shoulder)  
Rock and roll, Evan. Rock and roll.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - LATER THAT MORNING

The camera moves down the empty street, past the boarded windows and faded signs, past the homeless people and the stray dogs.

But something is different now. There's a charge in the air. A crackle of electricity. The few people on the street move with a little more purpose, look up at the sky a little more often.

The tide is turning.

### EXT. FRANK'S HABERDASHERY - SIDEWALK - MONDAY AFTERNOON

FRANK (60s, haberdasher, kind eyes) stands in his doorway, looking down the street toward the Reno Men's Club. A few WORKERS carry in new curtains, lighting equipment. The club's doors are open.

MARCUS (50s, trumpet case in hand) approaches from the corner. ROSA (70s, elegant, cane) sits on a bench nearby, watching.

**FRANK**  
You going in?

**MARCUS**  
I heard they're putting together a band. Big band. Glen Miller's name was mentioned. I don't know if it's true.

**FRANK**  
I've seen Howard Hughes go in and out twice today. And a man who looks like he could be Evan Bondonte — runs the club — he's been directing workers all morning. Something's happening.

Rosa rises from the bench and joins them.

**ROSA**  
I've lived on this street for forty years. I've seen the tide go out. I've seen the shells empty. But this morning — when I walked past the club — I felt something. A charge. Like the tide might be turning.

**MARCUS**  
I hope you're right. I haven't played with a real band in twenty years.

**FRANK**  
Then go in. Ask for Evan. Tell him you're a trumpet player. Tell him you want to be part of whatever they're building.

Marcus looks at the club. The doors are open. Light spills out. He nods, picks up his case, and walks toward the club.

Frank and Rosa watch him go.

**ROSA**  
Do you think they'll let us in? When they're ready?

**FRANK**  
I think that's the whole point. A place for us. For everyone. For the golden age.

Rosa smiles. The two of them stand there, watching, as Marcus disappears inside.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON

Evan sits at one of the tables, a laptop open in front of him, a phone pressed to his ear.

**EVAN**  
(into phone)  
We're bringing back the golden age. Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. The whole nine yards. And we're doing it here, in downtown Reno, at the Reno Men's Club. Ground zero.

He listens.

**EVAN** (CONT'D)  
I know it sounds crazy. But I'm telling you, this is real. Howard Hughes is here. He's taking charge. And we need musicians. We need conductors. We need people who remember what the golden age was all about.

He listens again, then smiles.

**EVAN** (CONT'D)  
Excellent. I'll email you the details. See you tomorrow.

He hangs up and makes a note on his laptop.

Howard Hughes walks over, carrying a rolled-up set of blueprints.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
How many?

**EVAN**  
Six confirmed so far. Another dozen maybes.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Good. We need at least seventeen. A full orchestra.

He unrolls the blueprints on the table. They show the main room of the club, with detailed plans for renovations.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
The main room becomes the ballroom. Big enough for a full orchestra and a dance floor that can hold a hundred couples. The bar stays where it is, but we upgrade it, polish it, make it shine. The cabaret stage gets restored — new curtains, new lighting, the works.

He points to a small room off to the side.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
And the restroom — the men's restroom where you were standing this morning — stays exactly as it is. Ground zero. The place where it all began.

**EVAN**  
Why?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Because people need to know where they came from. They need to remember the low tide, so they can appreciate the flood when it comes.

Evan nods, understanding.

**EVAN**  
When does Glen Miller arrive?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Tomorrow. Noon. And once he's here, the rest will follow.

**EVAN**  
The rest?

Howard Hughes rolls up the blueprints.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
The greats. The legends. The ones who made the golden age what it was. They're all coming, Evan. It's a gold rush.

He walks toward the door, then pauses and looks back.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Hank Williams Sr. is coming. Wednesday. He's announcing permanent residency. After all those tragic early endings, he's finally found a place to rest.

Evan feels tears prick at the corners of his eyes.

**EVAN**  
(softly)  
The golden age is really returning.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
(smiling)  
It already has.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - TUESDAY MORNING

A TAXI pulls up in front of the Reno Men's Club.

The back door opens, and GLEN MILLER (50s, dressed in a simple gray suit) steps out, carrying a single suitcase and his trombone case.

He stands on the sidewalk for a moment, looking around at the empty shells and barnacles of downtown Reno. His expression is equal parts sadness and hope.

PEOPLE on the street stop and stare. They don't know who he is, not exactly, but they know he's somebody.

Evan appears in the doorway of the club.

**EVAN**  
Mr. Miller. Welcome.

Glen Miller turns to face him, then walks forward and extends his hand.

**GLEN MILLER**  
Call me Glen. And thank you. It's good to be here. It's good to be anywhere, frankly. I've been gone a long time.

**EVAN**  
Too long. But you're here now. And we've got work to do.

Glen Miller smiles — the kind of smile that makes you want to smile back, that makes you feel like everything is going to be all right.

**GLEN MILLER**  
Let's get to it, then.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard Hughes stands in the center of the empty dance floor, waiting.

Glen Miller enters, followed by Evan. He sets down his suitcase and trombone case.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Glen. It's been too long.

**GLEN MILLER**  
Howard. I heard you were behind this. I should have known. Nobody else would have the vision. Nobody else would have the guts.

They shake hands.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Vision and guts. That's all it takes, really. That and a willingness to believe that the golden age isn't something that's lost forever.

Glen Miller looks around the empty club.

**GLEN MILLER**  
It's going to take some work.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Everything worth doing takes work. But we've got time. Six days. By Super Bowl Sunday, this place is going to be transformed. And you're going to be at the center of it all.

He walks closer to Glen Miller.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
You're going to head up the return to the golden age. Big bands. Floor dancing. Gatsby. The whole nine yards.

**GLEN MILLER**  
(eyes lighting up)  
Gatsby. I like that. I like that a lot.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
I thought you might. So here's the plan. We're launching the Big Band Project today. We're putting out the call for musicians, conductors, arrangers. And you're going to lead them.

Glen Miller opens his trombone case and takes out the instrument that made him famous.

He puts it to his lips and blows a single, clear note that fills the empty club and spills out into the street beyond.

Evan feels tears streaming down his face.

The golden age has truly returned.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MEN'S RESTROOM - MONDAY NIGHT

Evan stands before the mirror again. The club is dark behind him. Streetlights cast long shadows through the windows.

**EVAN**  
(to his reflection)  
I was protecting identities.

He pauses. The words hang in the air.

**EVAN** (CONT'D)  
I kept the names out. I kept the real people protected. I built something that could hold them without exposing them.

He straightens his tie.

**EVAN** (CONT'D)  
And now they're coming out. Howard Hughes. Glen Miller. Hank Williams Sr. The legacies. Walking out of the shell and into the light.

He turns and walks out.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - TUESDAY EVENING

The room is lit. MUSICIANS sit in folding chairs — seventeen pieces. Glen Miller stands before them, baton in hand.

**GLEN MILLER**  
From the top. "In the Mood." And remember — we're not just playing notes. We're playing a feeling. We're playing the golden age.

He counts them in. One, two, three, four.

The orchestra explodes into life. Raw at first — wrong notes, missed entrances. But underneath, something glorious.

Glen Miller stops them halfway through.

**GLEN MILLER** (CONT'D)  
Trumpets — you're rushing. Saxophones — blend. Let's try again.

They try again. And again. By the tenth run-through, the sound is tighter, brighter, swinging.

Evan and Howard Hughes watch from the back of the room.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
(to Evan)  
Tomorrow we rehearse again. And by Saturday night, we're going to give this town a show they'll never forget.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - TUESDAY AFTERNOON

The room is filled with MUSICIANS — trumpeters, saxophonists, drummers, pianists, trombonists. They sit in folding chairs arranged in a semicircle, their instruments in their hands, their eyes on Glen Miller.

Glen Miller stands in front of them, his trombone in his hands, a music stand in front of him.

**GLEN MILLER**  
Gentlemen. Welcome. Welcome to the return of the golden age.

The musicians applaud.

**GLEN MILLER** (CONT'D)  
We've got four days. Four days to rehearse. Four days to get tight. Four days to remember what it felt like to play music that made people want to get up and dance.

He raises his trombone.

**GLEN MILLER** (CONT'D)  
Let's start with "In the Mood." From the top. And remember — this isn't about showing off. This is about blending. This is about making the whole greater than the sum of its parts. This is about the golden age.

He counts them in.

**GLEN MILLER** (CONT'D)  
One, two, three, four...

The orchestra explodes into life.

The sound is glorious — rich and full and swinging. It fills the club and spills out into the street.

PEOPLE on the sidewalk stop and listen. Some of them start to sway. Some of them start to smile.

The tide is turning.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - SIDEWALK - THURSDAY AFTERNOON

FRANK the haberdasher stands in his doorway. MARCUS the trumpet player stands beside him, instrument case in hand. ROSA stands a little apart, hands clasped. They listen to the orchestra — "Moonlight Serenade" spills from the club.

**FRANK**  
How long has it been? Since you played with a band like that?

**MARCUS**  
Twenty years. Maybe more. I'd forgotten what it sounded like.

**FRANK**  
We all did. And now it's coming back.

Rosa steps closer.

**ROSA**  
Do you think they'll let us in? When they open?

**FRANK**  
I think that's the whole point. A place for us. For everyone. For the golden age.

Rosa smiles. Inside, the orchestra launches into "String of Pearls." The sidewalk crowd grows. The tide is turning.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - WEDNESDAY MORNING - DAWN

Evan walks the empty street alone. Pre-dawn dark. The Silver Legacy and El Dorado loom in the distance.

He pauses at Frank's haberdashery — closed. He pauses at the bench where Rosa had smiled. The tide is turning. He can feel it.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - WEDNESDAY MORNING - CONTINUOUS

Howard Hughes stands in the center of the empty dance floor. Evan enters.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Couldn't sleep?

**EVAN**  
Too much on my mind.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Today's the day. Hank arrives. King Robbie arrives. The picture gets bigger.

**EVAN**  
Do you ever wonder if we're moving too fast?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
(smiling)  
Every day. And every day I remember: the golden age doesn't wait. When it's time, it's time. And it's time now.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - WEDNESDAY MORNING

A MAN walks down the street, a guitar slung over his shoulder, his hat pulled low over his eyes.

This is HANK WILLIAMS SR. (30s, but with eyes that have seen too much).

PEOPLE recognize him immediately. They stop in their tracks. They point. They whisper. Some of them cry.

Hank Williams Sr. pays them no mind. He just keeps walking, his eyes fixed on the Reno Men's Club.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Evan waits at the door. When he sees Hank Williams Sr. approaching, he steps outside.

**EVAN**  
Mr. Williams. Welcome. Welcome home.

Hank Williams Sr. looks at him for a long moment, his eyes searching.

Then he smiles — the saddest, most beautiful smile Evan has ever seen.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
Home. I like the sound of that.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard Hughes and Glen Miller stand, waiting.

Hank Williams Sr. enters. He sets down his guitar.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Hank. It's an honor.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
The honor's mine. I heard what you're doing here. And I wanted to be part of it. I wanted to have a place to call home.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
You've got it. Permanent residency. This is your home now, Hank. For as long as you want it.

Hank Williams Sr. looks around the club.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
It's perfect. It's exactly what I need.

Glen Miller steps forward.

**GLEN MILLER**  
We're putting together a variety show. Big bands on Saturday night, Cajun music on Friday, and we want you to headline Wednesday nights. The Hank Williams Variety Show. Your music, your style, your way.

Hank Williams Sr. looks at him, then at Howard Hughes, then at Evan.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
I say yes. I say hell yes.

He picks up his guitar, sits down on the edge of the stage, and begins to play.

The song is "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry."

The sound fills the empty club with a sadness so profound, so achingly beautiful, that everyone in the room feels their heart break and mend and break again.

When the song ends, there is silence.

Then Howard Hughes begins to clap, slowly, deliberately.

Glen Miller joins him. Evan joins them.

Hank Williams Sr. stands and takes a bow.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
Thank you. Thank you for giving me a home. Thank you for honoring all those tragic early endings.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
No. Thank you. Thank you for coming back. Thank you for being part of this.

And in that moment, they have crossed a threshold. They have moved from planning to doing, from dreaming to creating, from the low tide to the flood.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON

A dusty PICKUP TRUCK pulls up in front of the club.

KING ROBBIE (40s, weathered, the look of a man who has worked the land) steps out, looking around at downtown Reno with curious eyes.

Evan approaches.

**EVAN**  
Can I help you?

**KING ROBBIE**  
I'm King Robbie. Drove down from Sonoma. I heard about what's happening here and I wanted to be part of it.

**EVAN**  
You came all the way from Sonoma?

**KING ROBBIE**  
I've got several Ultimate Baller V's back home who are interested in what you're up to. But I need to understand it myself first. I need to be able to explain it, to sell it.

Evan studies him — something earnest about this man, something genuine.

**EVAN**  
Come inside. Let me introduce you to Howard Hughes.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard Hughes turns as Evan enters with King Robbie.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
You must be King Robbie. Sonoma, right? Wine country.

**KING ROBBIE**  
(slightly starstruck)  
Yes, sir. I've got folks back home who might be interested. But I need to learn the ropes first.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Then you've come to the right place. We're going to spend this week getting you up to speed. By Sunday — by Super Bowl Sunday — you're going to know this operation inside and out.

He puts his arm around King Robbie's shoulder.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Right now, you're somewhere between cadet and silver wings. That's where everyone starts. But by the time we're done with you, you're going to be somewhere between silver and gold. You're going to earn those wings, King Robbie.

**KING ROBBIE**  
I'm ready. Whatever it takes.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Good. First lesson: the golden age isn't just about music and dancing. It's about connection. It's about community. It's about giving people something to believe in. That's what you're going to sell to those Ultimate Baller V's back in Sonoma.

King Robbie nods, his expression serious.

And his training begins.

## ACT TWO: THE FLOOD
### Thursday, February 6 — Saturday, February 8, 2026

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - BACK ROOM - THURSDAY MORNING

King Robbie sits beside Hank Williams Sr., notebook in hand, watching the musician work through his set list.

EVAN (V.O.)  
This was King Robbie's second day of training. Already the hesitancy was gone.

**EVAN**  
(to King Robbie)  
You see how Hank works? He doesn't just play music. He tells stories. That's what you're going to do with those Ultimate Baller V's back in Sonoma.

**KING ROBBIE**  
(eyes bright)  
I'm starting to get it. It's not about the product. It's about the feeling.

**EVAN**  
Now you're learning. Now you're earning those wings.

### CUT TO:

### INT. HOWARD HUGHES' OFFICE - RENO MEN'S CLUB - THURSDAY MORNING

Howard Hughes sits at his desk, watching the news on his laptop. His expression is grave.

Evan enters without knocking.

**EVAN**  
You need to see this.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
I'm already seeing it.

He turns the laptop so Evan can see the screen. The headline reads: "BITCOIN PLUNGES AS RUMORS OF COLLAPSE SPREAD."

**EVAN**  
Is it true?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Does it matter? True or not, the rats are jumping ship. They're panicking. They're selling everything and running for the exits.

**EVAN**  
And where are they running to?

Howard Hughes smiles.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
That's the question, isn't it? Where do you run when the ship is sinking?

**EVAN**  
(slowly)  
You go to something real. Something solid. Something that's been around for a long time and will be around for a long time to come.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Exactly. You go to the golden age. You go to Vibelandia.

He closes the laptop and stands up.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
The floating ship is pulling alongside the sinking ship. And the bold-hearted are about to board. Are we ready for them?

Evan looks out the window at the street beyond.

**EVAN**  
We're ready. We've been waiting for this.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Good. Because by tomorrow morning, the miracle is going to happen. The rats are going to jump. And the bold-hearted are going to board the floating ship.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Glen Miller conducts the orchestra through a particularly tricky passage of "In the Mood."

Howard Hughes enters, Evan following.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
(calling out)  
Gentlemen!

The music stops.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Tomorrow is the day. Tomorrow the Bitcoin ship sinks. Tomorrow the bold-hearted board the floating ship. Tomorrow the world discovers that the golden age has returned. Are you ready?

The musicians look at each other, then at Glen Miller, then back at Howard Hughes.

**GLEN MILLER**  
(speaking for all of them)  
We're ready. Let's give them a show they'll never forget.

Howard Hughes nods.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Then let's get back to work. We've got one more day to prepare. One more day before the flood comes.

The music starts again, filling the club, spilling out into the street.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - FRIDAY MORNING

The street is empty. The sun rises over the buildings, casting long shadows.

Then, in the distance, a FIGURE appears. Walking slowly. Carrying a backpack.

This is MICHAEL CHEN (20s, pale and drawn).

He walks down the street toward the Reno Men's Club, where Evan, Howard Hughes, and King Robbie stand on the sidewalk, waiting.

King Robbie is there for his third day of training — learning how to welcome the newcomers.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
(quietly, to King Robbie)  
Watch how we do this. This is what you're going to do when you go back to Sonoma.

Michael reaches them and stops.

**MICHAEL CHEN**  
I heard you were building something here. Something real. Something that lasts. Can I be part of it?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
What's your name?

**MICHAEL CHEN**  
Michael. Michael Chen. I was a software engineer. I had everything in Bitcoin. And now I have nothing.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Not nothing. You have the courage to jump. You have the wisdom to recognize the floating ship when you see it. That's worth more than all the Bitcoin in the world.

He extends his hand.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Welcome to Vibelandia, Michael. Welcome home.

Michael Chen shakes his hand, tears in his eyes.

**MICHAEL CHEN**  
Thank you. Thank you for giving me a place to go.

### MONTAGE - FRIDAY MORNING TO EVENING

-- More PEOPLE arrive. One by one, then in groups, then in crowds. All of them pale and drawn. All of them having lost everything in the Bitcoin collapse. All of them looking for something real, something solid, something that lasts.

-- Evan takes names, makes lists, welcomes them. King Robbie stands beside him, watching, learning how to greet each newcomer with a handshake and a steady gaze.

-- Howard Hughes stands on the steps of the Reno Men's Club, addressing the growing crowd. His voice carries. "You had the courage to jump. The floating ship is here."

-- Inside the club, Glen Miller and his orchestra play "Moonlight Serenade." COUPLES dance, swaying, holding each other close. Frank the haberdasher and Rosa dance in the corner. Marcus the trumpet player sits in the band, his eyes closed, lost in the music.

-- Hank Williams Sr. sits on the cabaret stage, his guitar in his hands, singing "Your Cheatin' Heart" to a rapt audience. Tears on faces. Hands clasped. The golden age is no longer a memory — it is happening in the room.

-- King Robbie moves through the crowd with a tray of water glasses, learning service, learning how to read the room. Howard Hughes nods to him from across the floor. Approval.

-- The sun sets over downtown Reno, and the lights of the Reno Men's Club blaze like a beacon in the gathering darkness. The street outside is no longer empty. People linger. They listen. They believe.

### END MONTAGE

### EXT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - STEPS - FRIDAY EVENING

Howard Hughes stands on the steps, addressing a crowd of more than a hundred people.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
You are the bold-hearted. You are the ones who had the courage to jump, the wisdom to recognize the floating ship, the faith to believe that the golden age has returned.

He gestures behind him at the club.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Come inside. Come inside and see what we've built. Come inside and be part of it. Come inside and discover that the golden age isn't something that's lost forever. It's something that's here, now, waiting for you.

The crowd streams through the doors.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is packed. The dance floor is filled with couples. The bar is crowded. The cabaret stage is lit.

Glen Miller conducts the orchestra through "Moonlight Serenade."

Hank Williams Sr. sings "Your Cheatin' Heart."

And everywhere, everywhere, there is the sense of something vast and important and utterly unprecedented taking place.

The miracle has happened.

The rats have jumped ship.

The bold-hearted have boarded the floating vessel.

The golden age has returned.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - BACK ROOM - FRIDAY EVENING

Evan, Glen Miller, Hank Williams Sr., and a few other key players gather around a table.

Howard Hughes stands at the head of the table.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
We need to talk about legacies.

**EVAN**  
Legacies?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Superheroes, cast, crew, fans, franchises — and legacies. The living men themselves. The greats. The legends.

He looks around the room.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
You're all legacies. Glen, you're a legacy. Hank, you're a legacy. You're not just characters in a story. You're the living embodiment of the golden age. You're the proof that it's real, that it's here, that it's now.

Glen Miller leans back in his chair.

**GLEN MILLER**  
So what are you proposing?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
I'm proposing that we create a new department. A new layer. We call it Legacies. And it's for all of you. It's a way of honoring you, of integrating you into everything we do.

Hank Williams Sr. strums a chord on his guitar.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
I like it. It's about time someone honored the living men instead of just the dead ones.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Exactly. And here's the thing: this is a major value add. We're not just offering entertainment. We're offering legacies. We're offering the living men themselves. We're offering the golden age.

Evan feels that familiar shiver.

**EVAN**  
How do we do it?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
We update everything. We update the appraisals. We update the evaluations. We show them that we have something nobody else has. We have legacies. We have the golden age.

He walks to the window, looking out at the crowd.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
By Sunday — by Super Bowl Sunday — the world is going to know that downtown Reno is the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. They're going to know that legacies are the true franchise.

He turns back.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Are you with me?

Glen Miller stands.

**GLEN MILLER**  
I'm with you.

Hank Williams Sr. stands.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
I'm with you.

Evan stands.

**EVAN**  
I'm with you.

One by one, the others stand.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Then let's get to work. We've got one more day. One more day before Super Bowl Sunday. One more day before the birth is complete.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - SATURDAY MORNING

The room gleams. The dance floor shines. The bar sparkles. The cabaret stage is draped in new velvet curtains.

Glen Miller runs the orchestra through the full set list — "In the Mood," "Moonlight Serenade," "String of Pearls," "Chattanooga Choo Choo." Each number tightens. Each run gets closer to perfection.

Howard Hughes watches from the back, Evan beside him.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Tomorrow morning we do the gold wings ceremony. King Robbie. A few others who've earned it this week.

**EVAN**  
He's ready. He's been watching everything. Learning how to welcome people, how to read the room, how to sell the vision.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
That's what the golden age is. Vision. And the willingness to share it. By Sunday he'll be back in Sonoma, bringing in the Ultimate Baller V's. And they'll know — because he'll know — that this is real.

On the stage, Hank Williams Sr. runs through his set — "I Saw the Light," "Your Cheatin' Heart," "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry." His voice fills the club. The musicians pause to listen. Even Glen Miller stops the baton and lets the moment hold.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
That's the sound of the golden age. Not just the big bands. The legacies. The living men. Hank. Glen. All of them. That's what we're building here.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - BACK ROOM - SATURDAY EVENING

King Robbie sits with Evan, a notebook open in front of him. Howard Hughes stands at the head of the table.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Tomorrow morning. Super Bowl Sunday. We do the gold wings ceremony here, in the main room, before the doors open. You'll receive your wings. You'll understand what they mean — not just rank, but responsibility. You represent Vibelandia. You represent the golden age.

**KING ROBBIE**  
I'm ready. I've been ready since I drove down from Sonoma.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
I know. That's why you're getting the wings. But here's what happens next. You go back. You bring the Ultimate Baller V's. You don't just sell them a product. You give them a place to belong. A place where the golden age is real.

King Robbie nods. His expression is serious, focused.

**EVAN**  
You've seen it. You've lived it for a week. You've watched Howard. You've watched Glen and Hank. You've watched the bold-hearted walk through that door on Friday. You know it's real.

**KING ROBBIE**  
I know it's real. And I'm going to make sure everyone in Sonoma knows it too.

Howard Hughes extends his hand. King Robbie stands and shakes it.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Then get some rest. Tomorrow we complete the birth.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - SATURDAY EVENING (LATER)

The room gleams. The dance floor shines. The bar sparkles. The cabaret stage is draped in new velvet curtains.

Glen Miller and his orchestra rehearse, tight and polished.

Hank Williams Sr. paces backstage, his guitar in his hands, his eyes bright.

Howard Hughes is everywhere at once, checking details, making adjustments.

King Robbie works alongside Evan, helping to coordinate. This is day four of his training, and the transformation is remarkable.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
(to King Robbie)  
You're ready. You've earned your silver wings. By the time you leave tomorrow, you'll have gold.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - SATURDAY AFTERNOON

The room is quiet. Preparations are done. Evan stands alone, afternoon light slanting through the windows.

King Robbie approaches.

**KING ROBBIE**  
Nervous?

**EVAN**  
Terrified. And exhilarated. Both.

**KING ROBBIE**  
When I go back to Sonoma tomorrow — when I bring those Ultimate Baller V's into the fold — I'm going to tell them about this moment. The calm before the storm. The moment when we knew we were about to show the world something it had never seen before.

**EVAN**  
We're going to show them the golden age.

**KING ROBBIE**  
We're going to show them home.

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - SATURDAY MORNING

Evan and Howard Hughes stand on the sidewalk, watching the sun rise.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Tonight's the night. Tonight we show them what the golden age looks like. Tonight we show them that downtown Reno is the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood.

**EVAN**  
And tomorrow?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Tomorrow is Super Bowl Sunday. Tomorrow the world flips. Tomorrow the birth is complete.

He looks at Evan.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Are you ready?

**EVAN**  
(after a moment)  
I'm ready.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Good. Because tonight, we go into full reality mode.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - SATURDAY EVENING

The line outside the club stretches down the block.

PEOPLE have come from everywhere — Reno, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City.

The doors open at 7:30, and the crowd streams in.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - SATURDAY EVENING - 8:00 PM

The lights dim.

Glen Miller walks onto the stage, his trombone in his hands.

The crowd erupts in applause.

Glen Miller raises his hand for silence.

**GLEN MILLER**  
Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the return of the golden age. Welcome to the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Welcome to Mark Twain's Vibelandia.

The applause is deafening.

**GLEN MILLER** (CONT'D)  
Tonight, we're going to take you back. Back to a time when music was music, when dancing was dancing, when people knew how to have a good time. Back to the golden age.

He puts the trombone to his lips and blows the opening notes of "In the Mood."

The orchestra explodes into life.

The sound is glorious.

Couples flood onto the dance floor, swaying, spinning, holding each other close.

Evan stands in the back of the room, tears streaming down his face.

The golden age has returned.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - CABARET STAGE - SATURDAY EVENING - 10:00 PM

The lights dim again.

Hank Williams Sr. stands on the cabaret stage, his guitar in his hands, his hat pulled low.

The crowd falls silent.

He strums a chord, then begins to sing.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
(singing)  
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill, he sounds too blue to fly...

It's "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," and it's even more beautiful, even more achingly sad, than before.

The crowd is transfixed.

When the song ends, there is a moment of silence.

Then the applause begins, slow at first, then building, then roaring.

The entire club is on its feet, clapping, cheering, weeping.

Hank Williams Sr. takes off his hat and bows.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.**  
Thank you. Thank you for giving me a home. Thank you for honoring all those tragic early endings.

He puts his hat back on and strums another chord.

**HANK WILLIAMS SR.** (CONT'D)  
This is the Hank Williams Variety Show. And it's going to be here every Wednesday night. Right here, at the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Right here, at Mark Twain's Vibelandia.

He sings one more song — "I Saw the Light" — and the crowd sings with him.

The club is filled with light and music and joy.

## ACT THREE: THE BIRTH COMPLETE
### Sunday, February 9, 2026 — Super Bowl Sunday

---

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - SUNDAY MORNING - DAWN

The room is quiet. Empty. The crowd from the night before has dispersed.

Evan stands in the center of the empty dance floor, watching the light creep across the room.

Howard Hughes enters. King Robbie is with him — transformed from the hesitant man who arrived five days ago.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
King Robbie. Come here.

King Robbie walks over.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
When you arrived on Wednesday, you were somewhere between cadet and silver wings. You didn't know the language. You didn't understand the vision.

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small GOLD PIN — a pair of wings.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
But over the past five days, you've proven yourself. You've learned. You've grown. You've earned your way from silver to gold.

He pins the gold wings onto King Robbie's lapel.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
You're gold wings now, King Robbie. When you go back to Sonoma, you're going to bring those Ultimate Baller V's into the golden age. You're going to make them believers.

King Robbie looks down at the gold wings, then back up, his eyes glistening.

**KING ROBBIE**  
Thank you. I won't let you down.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
I know you won't. Now go make us proud.

(turning to Evan)  
Today's the day. Super Bowl Sunday. The world flips today. The birth is complete today.

**EVAN**  
What happens now?

Howard Hughes walks to the window.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Now we wait. We wait for the world to discover what we've built here. We wait for them to realize that downtown Reno is the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood.

He turns to face Evan.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
And then we keep going. We keep building. We keep creating. We keep honoring the greats. We keep giving them a place to call home.

**EVAN**  
Do you think they'll come? Do you think the world will care?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
They'll come. They always come. Because people are hungry for something real, something solid, something that lasts.

He walks closer to Evan.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
And we're offering them the flood. We're offering them the golden age. We're offering them home.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - SUNDAY AFTERNOON

The word has spread.

PEOPLE stream down the street toward the Reno Men's Club. Thousands of them. From Reno, from San Francisco, from Los Angeles, from New York, from London, from Paris, from Tokyo.

They have heard the news. They have seen the videos. They have read the stories.

They want to be part of it.

The line outside the club stretches down the block, longer than ever before.

### EXT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - STEPS - SUNDAY EVENING - 6:00 PM

Howard Hughes stands on the steps, addressing the crowd. There are thousands of them now, filling the street, packing the sidewalks.

SPEAKERS amplify his voice.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. Welcome to the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Welcome to Mark Twain's Vibelandia. Welcome home.

The crowd erupts in applause.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Six days ago, this place was a low tide that had never come back. It was empty shells and barnacles. It was a place that had died, or come close to it.

He pauses.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
But today, it's alive. Today it's vibrant. Today it's the birthplace of the new post-singularity Hollywood. Today the golden age has returned.

The applause is deafening.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
And how did it happen? We did it by honoring the greats. We did it by giving them a place to call home. We did it by recognizing that legacies — the living men themselves — are the true franchise.

He raises his hand.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
And now I want to make a proclamation. I want to declare, here and now, on this Super Bowl Sunday, that the birth is complete. That downtown Reno is the new Hollywood. That Mark Twain's Vibelandia is the capital of the impossible. That the golden age has returned.

He pauses.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Let the golden age begin. Let the legacies walk among us. Let the bold-hearted celebrate. The birth is complete.

The crowd erupts, cheering, clapping, weeping, celebrating.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Glen Miller and his orchestra begin to play "Moonlight Serenade."

The sound spills out into the street, filling the air with music, with joy, with the promise of something vast and important.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MEN'S RESTROOM - LATER

Evan stands before the mirror, looking at his reflection.

He barely recognizes the man staring back at him.

Six days ago, he was tired, worn down, ready to give up.

Now he's alive. Vibrant. Part of something bigger than himself.

The door opens. Howard Hughes enters.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
There you are. I've been looking for you.

**EVAN**  
I was just... remembering. Remembering what it was like six days ago.

Howard Hughes walks over and stands beside him.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
It's important to remember. It's important to know where you came from, so you can appreciate where you are now.

He looks at their reflections.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
Six days. That's all it took. Six days to go from low tide to flood. Six days to bring back the golden age. Six days to complete the birth.

**EVAN**  
Do you think it will last?

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
That's up to us. That's up to you and me and Glen and Hank and all the others. That's up to everyone who believes that the golden age is worth fighting for.

He turns to face Evan.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
But I'll tell you this. The golden age isn't something that just happens. It's something you create. It's something you build. It's something you protect. And as long as we're willing to do that, the golden age will last.

**EVAN**  
Then let's make sure it lasts.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Deal.

They shake hands.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOWNTOWN RENO - VIRGINIA STREET - ONE WEEK LATER - MONDAY MORNING

Evan stands on the sidewalk, looking around.

Downtown Reno is transformed.

The empty shells and barnacles are gone. The streets are filled with bustling shops and restaurants and theaters. The faded paint has been refreshed. The boarded windows are open.

PEOPLE smile, laugh, dance, celebrate.

The low tide has become a flood.

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Glen Miller and his orchestra rehearse.

Hank Williams Sr. works on new material.

AUDREY HEPBURN (elegant, timeless) plans a film festival.

CARY GRANT (suave, charming) organizes a classic movie night.

The legacies walk among them.

### EXT. SONOMA, CALIFORNIA - WINE COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS

King Robbie stands in a vineyard, gold wings on his lapel, talking to a group of well-dressed ULTIMATE BALLER V PROSPECTS.

**KING ROBBIE**  
I've seen it. I've been there. I watched the golden age return with my own eyes. And you need to be part of it.

The prospects lean in, interested.

**KING ROBBIE** (CONT'D)  
They gave me a chance. They trained me. They turned me from a cadet into gold wings in just five days. And now I'm bringing that opportunity to you.

One of the PROSPECTS nods slowly.

**PROSPECT**  
When can we go?

**KING ROBBIE**  
(smiling)  
How about next week?

### INT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard Hughes stands in the center of the dance floor, waiting.

Evan enters.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
Ready for another week?

**EVAN**  
Ready for another lifetime.

Howard Hughes laughs.

**HOWARD HUGHES**  
That's the spirit. Because this is just the beginning. There's so much more to come.

He looks around the club.

**HOWARD HUGHES** (CONT'D)  
The golden age has returned. And it's never going away again.

**EVAN**  
Never again.

The music starts up again, filling the club with the sound of big bands and floor dancing and Gatsby.

### FADE TO:

### EXT. RENO MEN'S CLUB - NIGHT

The lights blaze. The music spills out into the street.

PEOPLE dance on the sidewalk.

The camera pulls back, revealing the entire block, then the entire downtown, then the entire city.

Downtown Reno — Mark Twain's Vibelandia — is alive.

The golden age has returned.

The legacies walk among us.

And it's home.

### FADE TO BLACK.
