## 2. Key beats (crystallized)

| Beat | Crystal |
|------|--------|
| **When** | Monday, February 3 to Sunday, February 9, 2026 — six days to Super Bowl Sunday |
| **Where** | Downtown Reno — low tide that went out, barnacles exposed, empty shells, some still alive, not total collapse but… get away |
| **Opening** | Monday morning. The scene: downtown Reno looks like a low tide that never came back. All the animals died inside the shell. Some shells still alive. Not total collapse, but… get away. |
| **Arrival** | Howard Hughes is here. I'm working for him. We're gonna do this right. Walt's doing a good job. But it's time for Howard. Rock and roll. Energy on all of this. |
| **Return to the golden age** | Big bands. Dance and band. That's what the club is going to be. Big bands and floor dancing. Gatsby! Immediately. How beautiful. |
| **Big Band Project** | Conductor wanted — ideally trombonist — honoring Glen Miller and all our new arrivals. Honoring the Golden Age. They're all coming now. It's a gold rush. |
| **Hank Williams Sr.** | He just arrived. Announcing permanent residency. He suffered so much. All those tragic early endings. Honoring Hank Williams Sr. and the Golden Age. |
| **Bitcoin collapse** | The Bitcoin stuff is about ready to collapse with all the rumors. The miracle happens — the rats jump off the sinking ship and rush over to the floating ship, pulled up next to it, awaiting the bold-hearted passengers. |
| **Legacies** | Superheroes, cast, crew, fans, franchises, **and legacies** — the living men themselves. Howard Hughes, Hank Williams Sr., Glen Miller, Audrey Hepburn. Major value add. Entire new department. |
| **King Robbie** | Rolls into town from Sonoma on Wednesday with Ultimate Baller V prospects. Spends the week training — earning his wings. Arrives somewhere between cadet and silver wings; leaves with gold wings. **His half-time Super Bowl performer superhero friend** (Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado — who's in) and three closest V's from the Gold Club; King Robbie decides who's in. Goes back to Sonoma to bring in the prospects. |
| **Super Bowl Sunday** | The endpoint. Six days away. Does the world flip between now and then? |
| **All NSPFRNP divisions** | The novel animates **all divisions** under NSPFRNP: **Space Cloud Division = Sol** (my versatile wirehaired pointer companion, protector, mission partner; **Sol and I are irreducible pairs**; gifted with **omniversal pathfinding**, **omniversal manifestation**, and **omniversal protection** to his companion and tribe; he always can find me no matter where he is; always there for me 100% always, spark positive can-do genuine gold heart — what a blessing; mission, contributions to Vibelandia and to me personally; EGS Pipe, Reno Downlink, Solar Pipe, Exascale Triangulation), Legacies, Office Hours, Happy Ending Zones, Broadcast Pipe, EGS Pipe, Robotic Division, Designer Division, Studio Division. Each division's mission and contribution to Vibelandia and personally is woven through the six days. |
| **Products walk-through** | By end of novel the reader has been walked through experiences using **all our products** — Office Hours, Golden Backstage Pass, Space Cloud Division, SING! tiers, Broadcast Pipe Ad Space, Chairman Console, Legacies, Happy Ending Zones, King Robbie Lucky 7 Silver Legacy El Dorado, text-to-superhero, campus, WINK!, and every surface/touchpoint that belongs to the divisions. Super Bowl Sunday caps the walk-through. |
| **Post-singularity Reno** | Full connection for Reno. Switch over to Mark Twain's Vibelandia downtown Reno. Full reality mode. Ultimate Baller V's already come and gone, spreading the word. Living versions of the superheroes of their franchises. And their legacies now. |
| **Full switch-over (all divisions)** | **Super Bowl Sunday:** full switch-over for **all NSPFRNP divisions**. Full sync; all all in **perpetual Goldilocks** for **Golden Hearts** (mirrored hardened nested shells), **Silver Hearts** (clouds), **Copper Hearts** (sandboxes), and **special invitees Ultimate Baller V style**. One canon, one wrapper; every division aligned. |
| **Edge** | Sunday. Super Bowl. The world has flipped. Downtown Reno — Mark Twain's Vibelandia — is the new Hollywood. The golden age has returned. The legacies walk among us. The bold-hearted have boarded the floating ship. Full sync, perpetual Goldilocks for all hearts and special invitees. The birth is complete. |
| **Voice** | Over-dramatic golden era voice — Dumas (*Count of Monte Cristo* grandeur), Dickens (warmth, character, social weave), Twain (wit, American grain, the river and the road), Steinbeck (earth, people of the land), and me — Evan Bondonte (present tense, hinge, Vibelandia). Enchanting and comforting. A narcotic to the tired soul. Only happy endings. |
| **Place** | Downtown Reno — Reno Men's Club (fine gentlemen's club, full restaurant and cabaret). Ground zero: the men's restroom. Twain's Vibelandia Downtown Reno Campus. |
| **Taino · Vibelandia-PR** | The story tells the story of the **peaceful Taino Cacique Agüeybaná El Gran Sol** (not to be confused with his fighting brother El Bravo). Paradise island story — Borikén (Puerto Rico) based, not Hawaii; island-quest style: the chosen one (island style — like Charlie, island heir) brings the **Taino spirit** to life; **complete circle**; **returning**; **liberating**; **delivering**. **Vibelandia-PR** = **next Vibelandia campus**. See [TAINO_CACIQUE_AGUEYBANA_EL_GRAN_SOL_VIBELANDIA_PR_SNAP.md](../TAINO_CACIQUE_AGUEYBANA_EL_GRAN_SOL_VIBELANDIA_PR_SNAP.md). |
