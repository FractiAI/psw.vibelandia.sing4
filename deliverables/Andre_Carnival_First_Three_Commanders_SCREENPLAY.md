## COLD OPEN (2–3 min)

### FADE IN:

### EXT. MARINA - NIGHT - LATER (MONTH'S END)

Water. Dock lights. Three boats in different marinas, visible in quick cuts — a fifty-meter motor yacht, white hull, bridge lit; a sailing yacht, mast against the sky, deck worn; a sixty-meter corporate hull, forest of screens. On each bridge, a new console glows beside the old gear. The layer is on. No rip-and-replace. The gateway they built at Interlink and Brasil Software is real on real boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real. Then:

### EXT. DOCK - LATE AFTERNOON - SAME TIMELINE

PRU and ANDRÉ stand on the dock. Diego's sixty-meter hull behind them. Bridge lit. Layer on. They shake hands. Sun going down. Dock smells of salt and rope. In the mind the three boats are together. Three consoles. Three layers. Three commanders who partied at Carnival and then put the gateway on their boats with the people who built it. One month in Brazil. Not a demo. Not a simulation. Real product. Real installs. Real story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Seed was the message. Story was Carnival and the first three install. Now it's done. Full. We ran the show.

**ANDRÉ**  
Gateways. Interlink. Brasil Software. Carnival. The first three. We ran the show.

They walk. Behind them the layer is on. The story doesn't stop. One month in Brazil. Carnival. Three installs. Paulo. Rafael. Diego. Hands on. No subcontractors. The gateway they built at Interlink and Brasil Software is real on real boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real. We ran the show.

## ACT ONE: THE MESSAGE
### The Seed (~3,500 words)

### EXT. PORTO BRACHY - WHEELHOUSE - DAWN

The sun rises over the water. A man stands in the wheelhouse of a boat, phone in hand, reading. This is ANDRÉ (50s), captain's bearing, calm eyes. The friend's boat is a ketch. Old. Well kept. Salt on the glass. The water beyond is dark, then slowly takes the light.

SUPER: "PORTO BRACHY, BRAZIL"  
SUPER: "PRESENT DAY"

He reads the screen again. Then again. The only sound is water against the hull. The message is short. It had to be. He reads it word by word. *André, you know gateways — we worked on them together at Interlink and Brasil Software. Now we're doing it again: pre-singularity to post-singularity. For yachtsmen. For commanders like you.* He knows what a layer is. He knows what it means when you don't rip and replace. He and Pru had drawn boxes and arrows. They had argued about protocols and failover and where the layer stopped and the legacy began. They had never talked about yachts. They had never talked about Carnival. The message does. *EGS SING! MARINE is the new layer for the yacht. EGS SING! MARINE layers on GPS, bridge, comms. New seas. New experiences. New possibilities. New protection.* He scrolls. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He reads the rest. 50–50. Always. Launch at Carnival. Three top captains. One month in Brazil. Let's run the show. — Pru.

**ANDRÉ**  
(to himself)  
Gateways. Interlink. Brasil Software. We did that. Now this.

He scrolls. Reads the whole message again. EGS SING! MARINE. EGS SING! MARINE layers on GPS, bridge, comms. New seas. New experiences. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. 50–50. Always. Launch at Carnival. Three top captains. One month in Brazil. Let's run the show. — Pru.

He looks out at the water. A small smile. The friend's boat is quiet. The crew is still asleep. He can hear the water against the hull. A soft sound. A sound that had been there before Interlink. Before Brasil Software. Before gateways. The sea doesn't care what layer you run. The sea is the same. But the way you cross it can change. That's what the message is offering. Not a new sea. A new way to be on the sea.

**ANDRÉ** (CONT'D)  
Carnival. Three captains. One month. Run the show.

He types a reply. Short. *I'm in. When do we start?* Sends it. Puts the phone down. The sun is full up now. He stands there a moment. The message had been the seed. His reply would be the lock. The rest would be work. The rest would be Carnival. The rest would be three boats and three commanders and the layer going on for real. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. OFFICE / HOME - DAY

PRU (40s, focused, practical) sits at a laptop. The proposal is on screen — yacht showroom, value prop, message to André. A notification: André has replied.

Pru reads the reply. *I'm in. When do we start?* Nods. Types back. *Carnival. Week one we celebrate. Week two and three we install. Send me the three names when you have them. We run the show.* Sends. Closes the laptop.

**PRU**  
(to self)  
We're in. Carnival. First three. Then we install. Full.

Pru gets up. Opens a drawer. Pulls out a checklist. Build. Cases. Cables. NMEA tap. Comms. Tools. Three boats. Paulo first — most complex. Fifty meters. Crew of twelve. If we can install there we can install anywhere. Rafael second — sailing yacht. Day and a half. Diego third — sixty meters. Three days. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. Pru reads the checklist. Verifies each item. The proposal is still on screen. The message to André. The value prop. The sentence that matters: *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* Pru closes the checklist. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PORTO BRACHY - BAR - NIGHT

André sits with two other CAPTAINS (50s). Drinks on the table. The bar is small. Photos of boats on the walls. Smell of salt and beer. André's phone is face-up. He has just sent the list of three names to Pru.

**ANDRÉ**  
Three captains. Paulo, Rafael, Diego. They've read the proposal. They've seen the layer. They want it on their boats. And they want us there when it goes on.

**CAPTAIN 1**  
You and the one who built it?

**ANDRÉ**  
Pru. We built gateways together. Interlink. Brasil Software. Same idea — layer on top, no rip-and-replace. Now we're doing it for yachts. For commanders. Carnival we celebrate. Then we install. First three. Hands on.

**CAPTAIN 2**  
No subcontractors?

**ANDRÉ**  
No subcontractors. Pru and me. All three installs. That's the deal. They get the people who built it. They get the story.

**CAPTAIN 1**  
That's the story.

**ANDRÉ**  
That's the story. And we're running the show.

**CAPTAIN 2**  
When do you close the three?

**ANDRÉ**  
I'm calling Paulo in the morning. Then Rafael. Then Diego. I have the link. I have the proposal. They've already seen the tech. They know what a layer is. They just need to hear it from me. We run the show.

They drink. The bar fills. The talk turns to weather and routes. André checks his phone. No reply from Pru yet. He doesn't need one. They've always understood each other in few words. The message had been the seed. His reply had been the lock. The rest would be work. The rest would be Carnival. The rest would be three boats and three commanders and the layer going on for real. He'll call Paulo in the morning. Then Rafael. Then Diego. He has the link. He has the proposal. He has the three names. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PORTO BRACHY - ANDRÉ'S OFFICE (ABOVE CHANDLERY) - DAY

Small room. Laptop open. Proposal on screen. Through the window: docks, water, boats. André reads. Scrolls. Reads the value prop. The tour of solutions. The reseller program. The full tech at captain level. He stops at the sentence.

**ANDRÉ**  
(to himself)  
Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

He reads the novel title. *André's Carnival: The First Three Commanders.* Seed: the message. Story: Pru at Carnival celebrating and helping the first three customers install. He reads the one-liner. At Carnival, Pru and André celebrate and help the first three commanders install — the gateway we built together at Interlink and Brasil Software is now real on their boats. One month in Brazil. Week of partying, then installing and launching. Running the show together. He reads the reseller program. 50–50. The tour of solutions. The full tech at captain level. He reads the sentence again. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He knows what he's offering. Not a dream. A layer. A story. A month. Three captains. We run the show.

**ANDRÉ** (CONT'D)  
(to himself)  
We're not selling a dream. We're selling a layer. And the story is the proof.

He closes the laptop. Through the window the docks. The water. The boats. He has the three names. Paulo. Rafael. Diego. He'll call them in the morning. First Paulo. Then Rafael. Then Diego. The order is right. The story is right. He has the three names. Paulo. Rafael. Diego. He has the proposal. He'll call them in the morning. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PORTO BRACHY - ANDRÉ ON PHONE - DAY

André on the dock. Phone to his ear. Dock sounds: winch, voices, water. Morning light on the hulls.

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo. I'm launching something at Carnival. Pre-singularity to post-singularity. A layer over what you already have. No rip-and-replace. The person who built it with me is coming. We're going to celebrate. Then we're going to install on three boats. The first three. You in?

Beat. He listens. Paulo's voice, careful.

**ANDRÉ** (CONT'D)  
I'm saying it. We add. We don't tear out. You keep your Furuno. You keep your Raymarine. We sit on top. We read. We advise. We add the new layer. Your crew keeps running the boat the same way. They just get more.

Beat.

**ANDRÉ** (CONT'D)  
Pru. We built gateways together. Interlink. Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. Now we're doing it for yachts. For commanders. Carnival we celebrate. Then we install. First three. Hands on.

Beat. He nods.

**ANDRÉ** (CONT'D)  
Send me the link. I'll read it. If the tech spec matches what you're saying, I'm in.

He hangs up. Sends the link. Waits. He doesn't move. He knows Paulo. Fifty meters. Crew of twelve. If they can install there they can install anywhere. Paulo will read every word. He'll hold them to it.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. PORTO BRACHY - DOCK - LATE AFTERNOON

André walks the dock. Boats on both sides. He knows every hull. He's chosen the three for a reason. Paulo: most complex. If they can install there they can install anywhere. Paulo will read the tech spec. He'll hold them to no rip-and-replace. Rafael: trust. He's sailed with André. Crossed the South Atlantic. He'll want the layer. He'll want them there when it goes on. Diego: biggest boat. Deepest pockets. His owners have a fleet. They don't want to rip out a million dollars of gear. They want to add. Diego had said six months ago: when it's real I want in. So the three were chosen. Paulo first. Rafael second. Diego third. The order is right. The story is right. We run the show. André stops. Looks at the water. The message had been the seed. His reply had been the lock. The rest would be work. The rest would be Carnival. The rest would be three boats and three commanders and the layer going on for real.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PAULO'S LOCATION - LATER - DAY

PAULO (50s, tall, gray at temples) at a table. Laptop open. Reading the proposal. Scrolls. Stops at the value prop. *Pre-singularity to post-singularity. For yachtsmen. For commanders. EGS SING! MARINE. A new shell for the yacht. EGS SING! MARINE layers on GPS, bridge, comms.* He scrolls. Stops at the tech spec. NMEA. Comms tap. We read. We don't write to the bus in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. We're a listener. We're an add-on. He reads the sentence about the abstract layer. *Ours is an abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking — and what the monthly fees are for.* He reads it again. He's run charters for twenty years. He's got Furuno and Raymarine and a crew that knows the boat inside out. He doesn't replace systems on a whim. He's seen too many captains rip out good gear and regret it. This is different. Add on top. Don't tear out. He nods. Picks up phone. Dials.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PORTO BRACHY - ANDRÉ ON PHONE - AFTERNOON

André's phone rings. He answers. He's in his office. Window open. Docks below.

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo.

**PAULO** (V.O.)  
I'm in. I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace.

**ANDRÉ**  
You can hold me to it. We're running the show.

**PAULO** (V.O.)  
I read the spec. You add. You don't touch the critical path. My chief officer will be there. He needs to see it. The crew needs to see it.

**ANDRÉ**  
They'll see it. We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have.

**PAULO** (V.O.)  
Carnival. Then my boat first.

**ANDRÉ**  
Carnival. Then your boat. First of three. Pru and me. Hands on.

He hangs up. Writes Paulo's name on a list. One down. Two to go.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ANDRÉ ON PHONE - DOCK - LATE AFTERNOON

André walking the dock. Phone to his ear. Water. Boats. Sun low.

**ANDRÉ**  
Rafael. I'm launching something at Carnival. A layer. No rip-and-replace. Pru and me. We celebrate. Then we install on three boats. The first three. I want you in.

**RAFAEL** (V.O.)  
I want the new seas. I've read about it. I want the layer. And I want you two there when it goes on. Not a subcontractor. You. And the one who built it.

**ANDRÉ**  
That's the deal. Pru and me. Hands on. All three installs. Celebrating first. Then we help you put it on.

**RAFAEL** (V.O.)  
I'm in. When do we start?

**ANDRÉ**  
Carnival. Week of party. Then we install. You're number two. Paulo's first. Then you. Then Diego.

**RAFAEL** (V.O.)  
Diego's in too?

**ANDRÉ**  
I'm calling him next.

**RAFAEL** (V.O.)  
You're running the show.

**ANDRÉ**  
We're running the show.

He writes Rafael's name on the list. Two down. One to go. He keeps walking. Rafael had sailed with him. Crossed the South Atlantic. He wouldn't need to be convinced twice.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ANDRÉ ON PHONE - NEXT MORNING

André at the chandlery counter. Coffee. Phone to his ear. Early. No one else yet.

**ANDRÉ**  
Diego. They said yes?

**DIEGO** (V.O.)  
The moment I explained it. They don't want to replace anything. They want to add. So do I. When's Carnival?

**ANDRÉ**  
February. Week one we celebrate. Week two and three we install. Paulo first. Then Rafael. Then you. Pru and me. Hands on. One month in Brazil. Running the show.

**DIEGO** (V.O.)  
My owners have a fleet. They've seen too many captains rip out good gear and regret it. Abstract layer. Add on top. That's what they want. I'm in. Send me the paperwork.

**ANDRÉ**  
Done.

He hangs up. Writes Diego's name on the list. Three down. Sends Pru a note: *Three captains. Paulo, Rafael, Diego. Carnival. We run the show.* He puts the phone down. Looks at the list. Three names. Three boats. One month. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PRU'S SPACE - NIGHT (BEFORE FLIGHT)

Pru at a desk. Laptop. Build on screen. Console image. NMEA reader. Comms tap. Verifying. Testing. Two cases on the floor: one hardware, one not. Pru packs cables. Connectors. Tools. Spares. Checklist on the screen. Paulo's boat: fifty meters, most complex. Crew of twelve. If we can install there we can install anywhere. Rafael's: sailing yacht, day and a half. Same discipline. Diego's: sixty meters, three days. Same discipline. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. Pru runs one more verification. Build is good. Cases are packed. Tomorrow: flight. Then Rio Iate Club. Then Carnival. Then Paulo's dock. Dawn. First of three. Pru closes the cases. Checks the latch. Ready.

**PRU**  
(to self)  
We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. We run the show.

Pru stands. Looks at the cases. One month. Carnival. Three installs. Hands on. No subcontractors. The story is the proof.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Pru walks through arrivals, one bag, one case. Sun. Heat. Brazil. A car waits. Pru gets in. The driver nods. They pull away.

**PRU**  
Rio Iate Club.

The driver nods again. The city streams past. Pru looks out the window. Calm. Ready. The cases are in the trunk. The layer is ready. The story is ready. We run the show.

### FADE OUT.

## ACT TWO: CARNIVAL
### The Week of Celebration (~4,000 words)

---

### FADE IN:

### EXT. RIO - HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Car on the highway. Pru in the back. One bag. One case in the trunk. The city ahead. Sun. Heat. Brazil. Pru looks out the window. Calm. Ready. The driver doesn't speak. The cases are in the trunk. The layer is ready. The build is verified. Paulo first. Then Rafael. Then Diego. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. We run the show. The city gets closer. Carnival is days away. The week of celebration. Then the week of work. One month in Brazil. The story is the proof.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RIO IATE CLUB - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Lights. Music. Crowds. Costumes. Confetti in the air. Pru gets out of the car. The driver hands over the bag and the case. ANDRÉ is at the door. He sees Pru. Comes down. They see each other. Handshake. No speech needed. Then:

**ANDRÉ**  
Welcome to Carnival.

**PRU**  
Let's run the show.

They go inside. The club is full. Noise. Movement. Heat. They find a corner. André raises a glass. Pru raises theirs.

**ANDRÉ**  
The three are here. Not all in the same room yet. But they're here. They've read the proposal. They've seen the layer. They want it on their boats. And they want you and me there when it goes on.

**PRU**  
That's the story.

**ANDRÉ**  
That's the story. Carnival first. Then we install. First boat, second boat, third boat. You and me. Hands on.

**PRU**  
Cases are in the car. Build is verified. We're ready when they are.

**ANDRÉ**  
Tomorrow we introduce you. Private room. Paulo, Rafael, Diego. They've signed. They've paid. They just need to see you. Hear it from you. Same thing they heard from me. We add. We don't tear out. We run the show.

They drink. The music swells. Around them, Carnival is beginning. The city is one organism. The week of celebration has started.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RIO IATE CLUB - BALCONY - SUNDAY MORNING

Pru and André. Coffee. The club is quiet. The streets are not — Carnival is building. Tomorrow the five meet. Paulo, Rafael, Diego. Private room. Introduction. Then the week of party. Then the installs.

**ANDRÉ**  
They've signed. They've paid. They just need to see you. Hear it from you. Same thing they heard from me. We add. We don't tear out. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

**PRU**  
I'll say it. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. We tap in. We read. We don't write in a way that could affect their ECDIS or their radar. Their boat keeps running the same way. They just get more.

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo will hold us to it. He's the most careful. If we satisfy him we satisfy everyone. Rafael trusts me. He'll want the new seas. Diego's owners wanted to add. They didn't want to rip out a million dollars of gear. So we're good. We run the show.

**PRU**  
Cases are ready. Build is verified. We're ready when they are. We tap in. We read. We don't write in a way that could affect their ECDIS or their radar. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. They'll see it. They'll believe it. Paulo first. Then Rafael. Then Diego. We run the show.

**ANDRÉ**  
They've signed. They've paid. They've read the proposal. They've read the tech spec. They're holding us to no rip-and-replace. We'll hold. We add. We don't replace. That's the product. That's the story. Tomorrow we lock it. Then we party. Then we install. First three. Done.

They drink. The city wakes. Tomorrow: the five in one room. The story locked. Then Carnival. Then the installs. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RIO IATE CLUB - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

Morning light through the windows. View of the harbor. André introduces three men. PAULO (50s, motor yacht captain, tall, gray at temples), RAFAEL (50s, sailing captain, weathered, calm), DIEGO (50s, corporate/charter captain, sharp, precise). Pru shakes each hand. Firm. No flourish.

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo, Rafael, Diego. The first three. They've signed. They've paid. They want the layer. No rip-and-replace.

**PAULO**  
I read the tech spec. I'm holding you to it. You add. You don't tear out.

**PRU**  
We add. We don't tear out. That's the product. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

**RAFAEL**  
I want the new seas. I want you two there when it goes on. Not a crew I've never met. You. And André.

**PRU**  
You get us. Both of us. All three installs. No subcontractors. Hands on.

**DIEGO**  
My owners said yes the moment André explained the abstract layer. They don't want to replace anything. They want to add. So do I.

**PRU**  
We'll be there. All three installs. André and me. Celebrating first — then we help you put it on.

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo first. Then Rafael. Then Diego. One week of party. Then two weeks of work. One month in Brazil. Running the show.

The three commanders nod. They raise glasses. So do Pru and André.

**PAULO**  
How long on my boat?

**ANDRÉ**  
Two days. Maybe three. Yours is the most complex. Fifty meters. Crew of twelve. We do it first. We learn. We tighten the process. Rafael's is simpler — a day and a half. Diego's is the biggest — sixty meters, three days. By then we've run the show. First three. Done.

**PAULO**  
I'll have my chief officer there. My crew will stay out of your way. But they'll watch. They need to see that we're not touching the critical path.

**PRU**  
We're not in the critical path. We're beside it. They'll see. We tap the NMEA bus. We read. We don't write in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. Your boat keeps running the same way. They just get more.

**PAULO**  
That's what I needed to hear.

**RAFAEL**  
Why me second?

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo's boat is the most complex. We do his first. We learn. We tighten the process. Yours is simpler. We do it in a day and a half. Diego's is the biggest. We do his last. Three days. By then we've run the show. First three. Done.

**DIEGO**  
My owners are impatient. They want it yesterday. But they don't want to rip anything out. So they wait. They're good with the order. We're a fleet. We want to add. Abstract layer. That's what they want. That's what I want.

**PAULO**  
So you tap into the bus. You don't replace the bus. You read. You don't write in a way that could affect our ECDIS or our radar. We're a listener. We're an add-on. That's what I read. That's what I'm holding you to.

**PRU**  
That's what you're holding us to. We tap in. We read. We don't write in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. Your boat keeps running the same way. You just get more. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. If our console goes dark you're still navigating. We degrade. You don't.

**PAULO**  
Who does the actual install? You two or someone else?

**ANDRÉ**  
Us two. Pru and me. No subcontractors. We're there for all three. Hands on. That's the deal.

**PAULO**  
Good. I want the people who built it. I don't want a crew I've never met.

**PRU**  
You get us. All three installs. We run the show.

**DIEGO**  
What happens if we want to expand? More boats. More captains. Same layer?

**PRU**  
Same layer. Same discipline. We add. We don't replace. Your fleet adds the layer boat by boat. Or you bring in other commanders. The reseller program is in the proposal. 50–50. André runs the bridge here. Rio Iate Club. Vibelandia-RJ. When we're ready for the next wave we'll talk. First we run the show. You three. Us two. Hands on.

**PAULO**  
My chief officer will have questions. Technical. He needs to understand where the layer sits. What it reads. What it doesn't do.

**PRU**  
We'll show him. We'll show the crew. We tap the NMEA bus. We read. We don't write in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. We're a listener. We're an add-on. If our console goes dark you're still navigating. We degrade. You don't. He'll see it. He'll believe it.

**RAFAEL**  
I've sailed with André. I don't need to be convinced. I want the layer. I want you two there when it goes on. That's the deal. I'm in.

They drink. The harbor is blue. The room is quiet. The five of them — the story is locked. Carnival first. Then the installs.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RIO - STREET - CARNIVAL MONDAY NIGHT

Parade. Drums. Floats. Dancers in feathers and sequins. The five of them — Pru, André, Paulo, Rafael, Diego — in the crowd. Heat. Sound like a wall. They find a place to stand. Raise glasses. The parade passes. Another follows. Costumes. Lights. The city is alive. They've been in the crowd for an hour. Heat. Sound. The five of them. They find a corner. Catch their breath. Raise glasses again.

**PAULO**  
I've seen Carnival before. Never like this. Never with the people who are going to put the layer on my boat. Next week you'll be on my bridge. Two cases. You'll tap in. You'll show my chief officer. You'll show my crew. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. I've read the spec. I'm holding you to it.

**PRU**  
You can hold us to it. We'll show them. We tap in. We read. We don't write in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. Your boat keeps running the same way. They just get more. That's the product. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

**PAULO**  
I've seen Carnival before. Never like this. Never with the people who are going to put the layer on my boat.

**PRU**  
That's the story. We party. Then we install. You get us. Hands on. No subcontractors.

**RAFAEL**  
I've sailed with André. I trust him. And I've read what you built. Interlink. Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. I want it.

**DIEGO**  
My owners want it. I want it. Let's run the show.

**ANDRÉ**  
One week. Then we start. Paulo's boat. Dawn. We'll be there. Two cases. You'll see the tap. You'll see that we don't touch your critical path. We're beside it. We add. You keep what you have. Then Rafael. Then Diego. We're not leaving until all three are live. You get us. Hands on. No subcontractors. That's the deal. We run the show.

**PAULO**  
We're ready.

**RAFAEL**  
We're ready.

**DIEGO**  
We're ready.

The parade passes. Another comes. The night goes on. The five stand there. Heat. Sound. Carnival. The story is real.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. RESTAURANT - TERRACE OVER WATER - TUESDAY DAY

The five at a table. Lunch. View of the harbor. Sun. Plates. Drinks. Water blue. City loud.

**PAULO**  
So you tap into the bus. You don't replace the bus.

**PRU**  
We tap in. We read. Position, heading, speed — whatever your existing gear is already putting on the bus. We don't write to the bus in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. We're a listener. We're an add-on.

**PAULO**  
What if the bus goes down?

**ANDRÉ**  
Your boat keeps running. Your ECDIS still works. Your radar still works. We're beside it. We're not in the path. If our console goes dark, you're still navigating. We degrade. You don't.

**PAULO**  
That's what I needed to hear.

**RAFAEL**  
What do we get that we don't have now? I've got good gear. I don't want to throw it away.

**PRU**  
You don't throw it away. You keep it. We add a layer on top. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Routes. Weather. Comms. All the data you already have, plus what the layer adds. Same idea we built at Interlink. At Brasil Software. Gateway. Layer. No rip-and-replace.

**DIEGO**  
My owners have a fleet. They've seen too many captains rip out good gear and regret it. Abstract layer. Add on top. That's what they want. That's what I want.

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo's boat first. Most complex. We learn. We tighten. Rafael's next. Day and a half. Yours is simpler. Diego's last. Three days. Sixty meters. By then we've run the show. First three. Done.

**PAULO**  
Who does the actual install? You two or someone else?

**ANDRÉ**  
Us two. Pru and me. No subcontractors. We're there for all three. Hands on. That's the deal. We built gateways at Interlink. At Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. Now we're doing it for yachts. For commanders. For you three. Carnival we celebrate. Then we install. First your boat, Paulo. Then Rafael's. Then Diego's. We run the show.

**PAULO**  
Good. I want the people who built it. I don't want a crew I've never met. I've read the spec. I'm holding you to no rip-and-replace. You add. You don't tear out. My chief officer will be there. My crew will watch. They need to see that you're not touching the critical path. They'll see. We're good.

**PRU**  
You get us. All three installs. We run the show. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. We tap in. We read. We don't write in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. Your boat keeps running the same way. You just get more. That's the product. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

**PAULO**  
What if we want to expand? More boats. Same layer?

**ANDRÉ**  
Same layer. Same discipline. We add. We don't replace. The reseller program is in the proposal. 50–50. When we're ready for the next wave we'll talk. First we run the show. You three. Us two. Hands on. First three. Done. Then the next will come.

**RAFAEL**  
I've sailed with André. I trust him. I've read what you built. Interlink. Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. I want it on my boat. I want you two there when it goes on. That's the deal. I'm in.

They eat. The water is blue. The city is loud. The five of them. The story is locked. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. TERRACE - TUESDAY EVENING

The five still at the table. Plates cleared. Drinks. The harbor is lit. Carnival noise in the distance. They've been talking for hours. Tech. Order. Timeline. Now it's stories.

**RAFAEL**  
I've sailed with André. We crossed the South Atlantic together. Same boat. Same weather. Same gear. When he said layer, I knew what he meant. We didn't rip out the old. We added. That's how we've always run.

**PAULO**  
I've run charters twenty years. I've seen captains rip out good gear and regret it. A million dollars. Gone. So when André said no rip-and-replace I read every word. I read the tech spec. You add. You don't touch the critical path. That's what I need. That's what my owners need.

**DIEGO**  
My owners have a fleet. They don't want to replace. They want to add. Abstract layer. That's the phrase they liked. Add on top. Don't tear out. So we're in. We're good with the order. Paulo first. Then Rafael. Then me. You two. Hands on. No subcontractors. That's the deal.

**PRU**  
That's the deal. We built gateways at Interlink. At Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. Now we're doing it for yachts. For commanders. For you three. Carnival we celebrate. Then we install. First your boat, Paulo. Then Rafael's. Then Diego's. We're there for all three. We run the show.

**ANDRÉ**  
One month in Brazil. Week one we party. Week two and three we install. Then we're done. First three. Live. The network will wake. The next will come. But first we run the show. You three. Us two. Hands on.

They drink. The harbor is blue. The city is loud. The five of them. The story is locked. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. SMALL CLUB - WALLS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF BOATS - WEDNESDAY NIGHT

Bar. Photos of races. Trophies. Men at the bar. Paulo knows two of them. Introduces Pru and André. Smell of salt and beer. The talk is boats. Routes. Gear.

**PAULO**  
These are the ones putting the layer on my boat. After Carnival. No rip-and-replace. They add. We run the show.

The men ask questions. André answers. Pru answers. Layer. Gateway. Interlink. Brasil Software. Same idea. Now for yachts. For commanders. First three. Hands on.

**CAPTAIN AT BAR**  
I might want in. After. If it's real.

**ANDRÉ**  
We're not leaving until all three are live. Paulo first. Then Rafael. Then Diego. When they're live we'll talk. If you want to be next, say so.

**CAPTAIN AT BAR**  
You two do the install? No one else?

**PRU**  
Us two. No subcontractors. That's the deal. They get the people who built it. They get the story. We're there for all three. Hands on. No one else.

**CAPTAIN AT BAR**  
I've heard about Interlink. Brasil Software. Gateways. Layer on top. Same thing?

**ANDRÉ**  
Same thing. Different client. Trucks and warehouses then. Yachts and commanders now. The logic is the same. We add. We don't replace. No rip-and-replace. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

**CAPTAIN AT BAR**  
Paulo's in. Rafael's in. Diego's in. They've all signed?

**PAULO**  
We've all signed. We've all paid. We've read the tech spec. We're holding them to no rip-and-replace. They add. They don't tear out. Carnival we party. Then they install. First my boat. Then Rafael's. Then Diego's. They're not leaving until all three are live. That's the deal.

**CAPTAIN AT BAR**  
I want the link. When you're done I might want in.

**ANDRÉ**  
When we're done we'll talk. First three. Then the next wave. We run the show.

Smell of salt and beer. The talk goes on. The club is full. Carnival outside. The week is building.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. HARBOR - WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON

The five walk along the harbor. Boats on one side. City on the other. Sun. Heat. They've left the club. They're talking about the install. The order. The tech. The story.

**PAULO**  
My boat is fifty meters. Crew of twelve. We run everything through one cabinet. ECDIS. Radar. Comms. You tap there, you see what we see. My chief officer will point. He's been with me ten years. He doesn't want anyone touching the critical path. You won't. You're beside it. I've read the spec. I'm holding you to it.

**PRU**  
We'll tap in. We'll read. We won't write in a way that could affect your ECDIS or your radar. We're a listener. We're an add-on. Your crew keeps running the boat the same way. They just get more. Your chief officer will see it. He'll believe it.

**RAFAEL**  
My boat is simpler. Sailing yacht. Smaller wheelhouse. Same idea. You tap in. You read. You add. I've sailed with André. I trust him. I've read what you built. Interlink. Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. I want it. I want you two there when it goes on.

**DIEGO**  
My boat is sixty meters. Corporate. Charter. The bridge is a forest of screens. My owners have a fleet. They don't want to rip out a million dollars of gear. They want to add. Abstract layer. That's what they want. That's what I want. Three days. You'll be there. You and André. Hands on. No subcontractors.

**ANDRÉ**  
Paulo first. Two days. Maybe three. Most complex. We learn. We tighten. Rafael second. Day and a half. Simpler. Diego third. Three days. Biggest. By then we've run the show. First three. Done. We're not leaving until all three are live. You get us. Hands on. We run the show.

They walk. The harbor is blue. The city is loud. The five of them. The story is locked. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. CLUB - TABLE - CARNIVAL THURSDAY NIGHT

Peak of Carnival. Noise so loud they lean in to hear. The five at a table. Music. Movement. Heat. Glasses on the table. The parade is endless outside. The city is one organism.

**ANDRÉ**  
We built this at Interlink. We built it at Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. Don't tear out the old. Add the new. Now we're adding it to yachts. To your boats. To the whole marine world.

**PAULO**  
Why Carnival?

**PRU**  
Because that's when we run the show. That's when we celebrate. That's when the three of you signed. And that's when we start. After the party we install. First your boat, Paulo. Then Rafael's. Then Diego's. We're there for all three. Hands on. No subcontractors. You get us.

The three commanders look at each other. They've already signed. They've already paid. But hearing it again makes it real.

**RAFAEL**  
To new seas.

**ALL**  
To new seas.

They drink. The parade passes. Another comes. The night goes on. The five of them. Carnival. The story. We run the show.

**PAULO**  
I've had crews in before. Subcontractors. They rip. They replace. Something breaks. Then you're stuck. This is different. You add. You don't tear out. I read the spec. I'm holding you to it.

**PRU**  
You can hold us to it. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. Your crew will see the tap. They'll see that we don't touch your ECDIS. We don't touch your radar. We read. We add. You keep what you have.

**RAFAEL**  
I've sailed with André. I've crossed oceans with him. I trust him. And I've read what you built. Interlink. Brasil Software. Same idea. Layer on top. I want it on my boat. I want you two there when it goes on.

**DIEGO**  
My owners have a fleet. They've seen too many captains rip out good gear and regret it. Abstract layer. Add on top. That's what they want. That's what I want. When's the install?

They go up to the bridge. Wheelhouse: leather, electronics, coffee. The chief officer points to a cabinet behind the main console. Paulo watches. Doesn't speak. He's run charters twenty years. He's seen crews rip and replace. He's seen the regret. This is different. Add on top. Don't tear out. He's read the spec. He's holding them to it.

**CHIEF OFFICER**

They've seen the tap. They've seen that no one touched the ECDIS. No one touched the radar. The bus kept running. Diego's owners have a fleet. They've seen too many captains rip out good gear and regret it. They wanted to add. So did Diego. The boat is the biggest. The install takes the longest. Three days. Same discipline. We add. We don't replace. When it's done, they run a test route. A test comms path. Everything works. The old screens are still primary. The new console is beside them. Layer on top of legacy. Diego's captain has watched. His chief officer has watched. They've seen the tap. They've seen that no one touched the ECDIS. No one touched the radar. The bus kept running. The layer is a listener. An add-on. Same as Paulo's boat. Same as Rafael's. Three boats. Same discipline. We add. We don't replace.

**DIEGO**  
Three boats. Three installs. You two did all of them. No subcontractors. Hands on. That's the story. My owners will want to know. I'll tell them. We partied at Carnival. Then you installed. You and André. Hands on. The layer is on our boat. No rip-and-replace. We keep what we had. We added. That's the story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. André's Carnival. The first three commanders. We celebrated. We installed. We ran the show. The gateway we built at Interlink and Brasil Software is on your boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real.

**ANDRÉ**  
One month in Brazil. The first three are live. The gateway we built at Interlink and Brasil Software is on your boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real.

Diego nods. His captain nods. His chief officer nods. The bridge is full of light — old screens and new console, layer on top of legacy. No rip-and-replace. Third of three. Done.

### CUT TO:

### INT. DIEGO'S BRIDGE - SAME DAY - LATER

Pru and André. Diego. His captain. His chief officer. Training. How to use the new console. How to read it. That the old gear is still primary. That the layer is there when they want more. Chief officer asks: what if we want to use the new console for primary nav? Pru: you can. But your ECDIS is still the primary if you don't. The layer shows the same data. It adds. It doesn't take over. What if the console fails? Your boat keeps running. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. We degrade. You don't. They've seen the install. They've seen the tap. They believe it. Diego shakes their hands. Third of three. Done. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. PAULO'S BRIDGE - HANDOVER - DAY

Pru and André. Paulo's chief officer. A few crew. Training. Showing them how to use the new console. How to read it. That the old gear is still primary. That the layer is there when they want more.

**CHIEF OFFICER**  
What if we want to use the new console for primary nav?

**PRU**  
You can. But your ECDIS is still the primary if you don't. The layer shows the same data. It adds. It doesn't take over. You're in control. The layer is there when you want more. Same on Rafael's boat. Same on Diego's. We've shown them. They've seen the tap. They believe it. We run the show.

**CHIEF OFFICER**  
What if the console fails?

**PRU**  
Your boat keeps running. We're beside it. We're not in the critical path. We degrade. You don't. Your ECDIS still works. Your radar still works. Your crew keeps navigating the same way. We're an add-on. We're not in the path.

**CHIEF OFFICER**  
I've seen the install. I've seen the tap. I believe it now. The crew believes it. We're good.

**PRU**  
Good. Your crew keeps running the boat the same way. They just get more. That's the product. That's what you're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. No rip-and-replace. That's the story.

**CHIEF OFFICER**  
What if we add more boats? Same layer? Same discipline?

**PRU**  
Same layer. Same discipline. We add. We don't replace. Your fleet can add the layer boat by boat. The reseller program is in the proposal. When we're ready for the next wave we'll talk. First we ran the show. You three. Us two. Hands on.

**CHIEF OFFICER**  
I've seen the install. I've seen the tap. The crew has seen it. We believe it. We're good.

Chief officer nods. The crew nods. They've seen it. They believe it. Same on Rafael's boat. Same on Diego's. Handover. Training. Sign-off. We run the show. The first three are live. The gateway they built at Interlink and Brasil Software is on three boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real.

### CUT TO:

### INT. RIO IATE CLUB - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY (AFTER FIRST RUNS)

The five reunited. Paulo, Rafael, Diego have each taken their boats out with the layer live. They're reporting back. André and Pru listen. This is what the new layer really delivers — brought to life.

**PAULO**  
We took her out. New seas — I mean it. We're exploring. The new navigation and protection benefits — we saw it. Everything runs by natural systems. Automatic. I've never had things run smoother. The layer coordinates, advises, integrates. Things have never run smoother. Two thumbs up. This is what it delivers.

**RAFAEL**  
Same. I explored routes I wouldn't have tried before. The navigation layer, the protection — we're seeing it. Automatic natural systems operation. Everything just works. Things have never run smoother. Two thumbs up. We bring to life what this layer really delivers.

**DIEGO**  
My owners asked. I said we're exploring new seas. We're seeing the new navigation and protection benefits. Everything runs on natural systems — automatic. Things have never run smoother. Experiences so we bring to life what this new layer really delivers. Two thumbs up. They want the fleet on it.

**ANDRÉ**  
That's the proof. You went out. You saw it. New seas. Navigation. Protection. Natural systems. Things running smoother. Two thumbs up. We run the show.

**PRU**  
That's what the layer delivers. You brought it to life. We run the show.

The five raise glasses. Two thumbs up. The first three have explored new seas, seen the benefits, felt the automatic natural systems — things have never run smoother. They return with enthusiasm. We run the show.

### CUT TO:

### INT. ANDRÉ'S SPACE - DAY

André at laptop. Sends message to network: *First three are live. Paulo, Rafael, Diego. We partied at Carnival. We installed together. The layer is on their boats. No rip-and-replace. If you want to be next, say so.* Replies come. One: *I heard from Paulo. The layer is real. I want in. Send me the link.* Another: *When can you do my boat? We're a fleet. We want to add. No rip-and-replace.* Another: *Rafael said you two were there. Hands on. No subcontractors. That's what I want. When's the next wave?* André answers each. Same message. We're running the show. The first three are live. When we're ready for the next wave we'll talk. He doesn't rush. He doesn't overpromise. The story is the proof. The first three were the proof. The network has woken. The next will come. He types to one captain: *First three are live. Paulo, Rafael, Diego. We partied at Carnival. We installed together. The layer is on their boats. No rip-and-replace. We're not leaving until they're all signed off. When we're ready for the next wave we'll talk. We run the show.* Sends it. The layer is real. The story is real. André answers the next. And the next. Same message. We're running the show. The first three are live. The network has woken. The next will come. The story doesn't stop.

### CUT TO:

### INT. VIBELANDIA-RJ - SUPPORT ROOM - DAY

Pru and André tour the campus. HQ. The people who will support the next installs. The next commanders. The next boats. Rio Iate Club was the bridge. Vibelandia-RJ is the anchor. The room is quiet. Screens. Maps. The same layer. The same story. No rip-and-replace. Add on top. A STAFF MEMBER shows them the support setup. Same console. Same build. When the next wave comes they'll have the same cases. The same discipline. We add. We don't replace.

**ANDRÉ**  
When you come back it'll be for the next three. Or the next ten. The story doesn't stop. The first three are live. Paulo. Rafael. Diego. We partied at Carnival. We installed together. The layer is on their boats. No rip-and-replace. They've seen it. Their crews have seen it. The network has woken. The next will come.

**PRU**  
The story doesn't stop. We run the show. The cases. The build. The story. We're ready when the next wave comes. Same discipline. We're beside it. We add. We don't replace. That's the product. That's what they're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

**STAFF MEMBER**  
We've got the same build. Same support. When you're ready for the next installs we're ready. Rio Iate Club was the bridge. We're the anchor. Same layer. Same discipline. We add. We don't replace. That's the product. That's what they're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for.

**ANDRÉ**

**PRU**  
Same cases. Same build. Same story. We're ready when the next wave comes. We run the show.

They stand there. Campus quiet. Water there. City there. Month over. Story not. The gateway they built at Interlink and Brasil Software is real on real boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real.

### CUT TO:

### EXT. DOCK - LATE AFTERNOON

Pru and André stand on the dock. Not the same marina. They've been to three. Paulo's. Rafael's. Diego's. This is the last. Diego's. The sixty-meter hull behind them. Bridge lit. Layer on. Three consoles. Three layers. Three commanders who partied at Carnival and then put the gateway on their boats with the people who built it. No subcontractors. Hands on. That's the story. In the mind the three boats are together. Three consoles. Three layers. Three commanders who partied at Carnival and then put the gateway on their boats with the people who built it. Water still. Sun going down. Dock smells of salt and rope.

**ANDRÉ**  
That's the story.

**PRU**  
That's the story. Seed was the message. Story was Carnival and the first three install. Now it's done. Full. We ran the show.

They shake hands. One month in Brazil. Not a demo. Not a simulation. Real product. Real installs. Real story. The layer — the abstract layer that layers over all legacy systems — is on three boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real. Paulo's boat. Rafael's boat. Diego's boat. Three consoles. Three layers. Three commanders who partied at Carnival and then put the gateway on their boats with the people who built it. No subcontractors. Hands on. That's the story.

**ANDRÉ**  
Gateways. Interlink. Brasil Software. Carnival. The first three. We ran the show. The message was the seed. Your reply was the lock. The rest was work. The rest was Carnival. The rest was three boats and three commanders and the layer going on for real. We ran the show.

**PRU**  
We ran the show. The network has woken. The next will come. When we're ready for the next wave we'll talk. Same cases. Same build. Same story. We add. We don't replace. That's the product. That's what they're booking. That's what the monthly fees are for. We run the show. The first three were the proof. Paulo. Rafael. Diego. We partied at Carnival. We installed together. The layer is on their boats. No rip-and-replace. The gateway we built at Interlink and Brasil Software is real on real boats. New seas. New experiences. New protection. Real. We run the show.

They walk down the dock. Behind them the three boats sit in their marinas. The layer is on. The story doesn't stop. The network has woken. The next will come. We run the show.
