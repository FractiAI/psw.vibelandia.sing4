## CANONICAL RULE

- **Tagline:** **100% BY NATURAL DESIGN!** — T-shirt tag branding. Wearable, punchy, NSPFRNP-aligned. The **100%** locks full commitment to natural system protocol; no compromise; by natural design.
- **Principle:** Ties to canonical [BY_NATURAL_DESIGN_SNAP.md](BY_NATURAL_DESIGN_SNAP.md) — the system follows natural system protocol; emergent, not forced; designed by natural patterns; max flexibility, quality, output at irreducible minimal cost.
- **Use:** Merch (T-shirts, caps), social bios, one-line CTAs, Launch Pad accents, deck §19 (T-shirt slogan), MASTER_BRANDING_CATALOG. Use wherever Natural System Protocol, SING! SQUEEZE!, net 0, Robotic Division, or Penrose expedition is referenced — and as standalone tag.
